A powerful globe of chilling moonlight explodes in the area, dealing `8d10` cold damage to creatures and objects in the area, plus `8d10` additional positive damage to undead creatures. Moonburst's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. Each creature and object in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature or object is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature or object takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature or object takes full damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature or object takes full damage.

>    If it's a creature, it's [blinded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for an unlimited duration. If the globe overlaps with an area of magical darkness, moonburst attempts to counteract the [darkness](../../Rules/traits/darkness.md) effect.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `1d10`, and the positive damage against undead increases by `1d10`.

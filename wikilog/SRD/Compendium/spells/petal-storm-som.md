# Petal Storm *Spell 4*   
[air](../../Rules/traits/air.md)  [conjuration](../../Rules/traits/conjuration.md)  [plant](../../Rules/traits/plant.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**15-foot radius burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You bring forth a cloud of razor-sharp flower petals that thrash violently in the wind. A creature that enters the storm or starts its turn in the storm is sliced by the razor-sharp edges of the petals. It takes `2d10` slashing damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature can take damage from the petals only once per round. At the end of the duration, the storm calms and the petals fall harmlessly to the ground.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d10`.

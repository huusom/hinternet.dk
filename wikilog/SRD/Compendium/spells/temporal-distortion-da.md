- **Mystery** Oracle

- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You share some of your own temporal distortions with a foe, altering their mind and body unpredictably as they're thrown backward or forward in time. Roll `1d4`. On a 1, the foe becomes [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy); on a 2, it becomes [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled); on a 3, it becomes [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied); and on a 4, you choose which condition applies.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is either [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy), [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), or [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for 4 rounds, depending on the result of the d4.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the time warp is stronger, increasing the condition's effects but making it run its course faster. The condition's value is 3, and the condition lasts for 2 rounds.

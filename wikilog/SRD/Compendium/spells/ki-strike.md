# Ki Strike *Focus 1*   
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

You focus your ki into magical attacks. Make an unarmed [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) or [Flurry of Blows](../../Rules/actions/flurry-of-blows.md) (this doesn't change the limit on using only one flourish per turn). You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls with the [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), and the [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) deal `1d6` extra damage. This damage can be any of the following types of your choice, chosen each time you [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md): force, lawful (only if you're lawful), negative, or positive.

**Heightened (+ 4)** The extra damage increases by `1d6`.

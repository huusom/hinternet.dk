# Spellwrack *Spell 6*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [curse](../../Rules/traits/curse.md)  [force](../../Rules/traits/force.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes `2d12` [persistent force damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). Each time it takes [persistent force damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from spellwrack, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana) check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); the curse and the [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) end after 1 minute.
> - **Failure** As success, but the curse and [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) do not end on their own.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the [persistent force damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is `4d12`.

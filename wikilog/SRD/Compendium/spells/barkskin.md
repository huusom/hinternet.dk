# Barkskin *Spell 2*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [plant](../../Rules/traits/plant.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 willing creature
- **Duration**10 minutes

The target's skin becomes covered in bark. The target gains resistance 2 to bludgeoning and piercing damage and weakness 3 to fire. After the target takes fire damage, it can [Dismiss](../../Rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell as a free action triggered by taking the damage; doing so doesn't reduce the fire damage the target was dealt.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistances increase by 2, and the weakness increases by 3.

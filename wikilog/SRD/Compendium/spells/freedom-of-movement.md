# Freedom Of Movement *Spell 4*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature touched
- **Duration**10 minutes

You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) an effect that has them [immobilized](../../Rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), or [restrained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Restrained), they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher level than the [freedom of movement](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/freedom-of-movement.md) spell.

Targets of this spell must be able to see, hear, or otherwise understand you. The targets must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target becomes mildly distracted by your display and applauds while it isn't fully occupied. It can't use reactions.
> - **Failure** The target applauds you so vigorously that it can't use reactions and is [slowed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Slowed). The applause is so involved that it has the [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait. This triggers reactions based on the [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait at the start of the target's turn.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, plus the target is so distracted by its vigorous applauding of you that it's [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) with you.

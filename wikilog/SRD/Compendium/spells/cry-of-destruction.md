# Cry Of Destruction *Focus 1*   
[cleric](../../Rules/traits/cleric.md)  [evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [sonic](../../Rules/traits/sonic.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[destruction](../setting/domains.md#Destruction)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot cone

Your voice booms, smashing what's in front of you. Each creature and unattended object in the area takes `1d8` sonic damage. If you already dealt damage to an enemy this turn with a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) or spell, increase the damage dice from this spell to d12s.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.

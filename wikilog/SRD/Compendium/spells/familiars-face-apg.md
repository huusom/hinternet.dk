The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses.

If you can cast a spell with the [revelation](../../Rules/traits/revelation.md) trait that affects your senses, such as [see invisibility](see-invisibility.md), while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use [Command an Animal](../../Rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) on the target as part of [Sustaining this Spell](../../Rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md). You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you [Cast this Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).

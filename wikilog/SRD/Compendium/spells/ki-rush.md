# Ki Rush *Focus 1*   
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

Accelerated by your ki, you move with such speed you become a blur. Move two times: two [Strides](../../Rules/actions/stride.md), two [Steps](../../Rules/actions/step.md), or one [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) and one [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) (in either order). You gain the [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition during this movement and until the start of your next turn.

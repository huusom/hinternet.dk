# Glitterdust *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. Each creature must attempt a Reflex save. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell, it is [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) instead of [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible). This applies both if the creature was already [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from this spell.

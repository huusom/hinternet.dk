[cursebound](../../Rules/traits/cursebound-apg.md)  [divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../Rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [oracle](../../Rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**up to 6 creatures
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to [Recall Knowledge](../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness), or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.
> - **Failure** As success, and the creature becomes [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) from the revelation of its dread secret.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature is [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

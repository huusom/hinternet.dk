You call forth a magical mist of positive energy that envelops a creature. The mist restores `2d8` Hit Points to a target living creature and ends one source of [persistent acid](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), bleed, fire, negative, or poison damage affecting it. If the creature is taking [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from multiple sources, you select which one is removed. Against an undead target, you deal `2d8` positive damage (basic Fortitude save); if it fails the save, it also takes 2 [persistent positive damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of healing (or damage to an undead target) increases by `1d8`, and the [persistent positive damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to an undead creature increases by 1.

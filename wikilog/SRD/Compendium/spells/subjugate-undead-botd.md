[mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**one undead creature with a level of no more than your level â€“ 4

- **Duration**varies

You attempt to seize control of the target. It can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If the target is already being [controlled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by another creature, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw and the undead uses the better result. Casting subjugate undead again ends any previous subjugate undead you cast.

> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 10 minutes.

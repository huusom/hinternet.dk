# Liberating Command *Spell 1*   
[enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You call out a liberating cry, urging an ally to break free of an effect that holds them in place. If the target is [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](../../Rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), or [restrained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Restrained), it can immediately use a reaction to attempt to [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md).

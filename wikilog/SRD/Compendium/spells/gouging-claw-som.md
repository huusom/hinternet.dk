You temporarily morph your limb into a clawed appendage.

Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC.

If you hit, you deal your choice of slashing or piercing damage equal to `1d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

On a critical success, you deal double damage plus `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6` and the [persistent bleed damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a critical increases by `1d4`.

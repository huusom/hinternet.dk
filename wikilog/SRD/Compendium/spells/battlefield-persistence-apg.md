# Battlefield Persistence *Focus 3*   
[cursebound](../../Rules/traits/cursebound-apg.md)  [divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md)  [oracle](../../Rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You are about to attempt a saving throw, but you haven't rolled yet.

You're difficult to remove from battle. You gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering save, and if the triggering save is against an [incapacitation](../../Rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect, it treats you as if you were 2 levels higher.

# Nymph's Token *Focus 1*   
[enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [sorcerer](../../Rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You grant an ally a token of favor. You create a token, such as a lock of your hair or a flower, that persists for the spell's duration; as part of [Casting the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) to pass the token to an ally within your reach. As long as the ally has the token on their person, they gain a +1 status bonus to [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) checks and Will saves. You can [Dismiss](../../Rules/actions/dismiss.md) the spell as a free action.

**Heightened (4th)** As long as the ally has the token on their person, you can cast spells that have a range of touch on them at a range of 30 feet.

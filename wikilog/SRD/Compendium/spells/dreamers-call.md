# Dreamer's Call *Focus 4*   
[cleric](../../Rules/traits/cleric.md)  [enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](../../Rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[dreams](../setting/domains.md#Dreams)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**until the end of the target's next turn

The target becomes distracted and suggestible, inundated by vivid daydreams.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target's attention wavers. It becomes [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by its daydreams.
> - **Failure** As success, except that you appear in the dream and give a suggestion. This can be to approach you, run away (as if it had the [fleeing](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) condition), [Release](../../Rules/actions/release.md) what it's holding, [Drop Prone](../../Rules/actions/drop-prone.md), or stand in place. The creature follows this course of action as its first action after you [Cast the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and it does nothing else.

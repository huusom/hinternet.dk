# Nondetection *Spell 3*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature or object
- **Duration**8 hours

You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to detect via magic. Nondetection attempts to counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-level spells for this purpose. Successfully counteracting a divination that targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects only for nondetection's target.

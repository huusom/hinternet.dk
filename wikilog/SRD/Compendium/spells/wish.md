# Wish *Spell 10*   
[divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A [wish](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell can produce any one of the following effects.

- Duplicate any spell from the arcane list of 9th level or lower to which you have access.
- Duplicate any spell from another spell list of 7th level or lower. It must be [common](../../Rules/traits/common.md) or you must have access.
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the [wish](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell.

The GM might allow you to try using wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.

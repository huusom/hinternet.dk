# Mage Hand *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](../../Rules/traits/cantrip.md)  [evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)

You create a single magical hand, either [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) or ghostlike, that grasps the target object and moves it slowly up to 20 feet. Because you're levitating the object, you can move it in any direction. When you [Sustain the Spell](../../Rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md), you can move the object an additional 20 feet. If the object is in the air when the spell ends, the object falls.

**Heightened (3rd)** You can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.

**Heightened (5th)** The range increases to 60 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.

**Heightened (7th)** The range increases to 60 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 2 or less.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental

You shake the earth, toppling nearby creatures. Choose whether the spell's area is a 15-foot emanation or a 15-foot cone when you cast it. Each creature in the area standing on solid ground may take `4d6` bludgeoning damage and must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

> [!success-degree]

> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and falls [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and falls [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone).

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by `2d6`.

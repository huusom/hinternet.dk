With enchanted gusto, you encourage yourself to get things done and share your motivation with your allies.

You gain a +1 status bonus to your choice of attack rolls, Will saves, or Charisma-based skill checks. During the spell's duration, an ally who [observed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Observed) you Casting this Spell and was within 30 feet when you did so can take a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, to gain the same bonus you chose until the start of its next turn.

Using this spell to influence someone in a social situation is typically considered a faux pas, negating the benefit on Charisma-based skills if the subject of the check [observed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Observed) you casting the spell.

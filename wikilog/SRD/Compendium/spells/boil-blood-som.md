# Boil Blood *Spell 8*   
[evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](../../Rules/traits/fire.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You heat a foe's blood and boil it within its veins. The target takes `10d10` fire damage, with a Fortitude save. A nonliving creature with blood in its body (such as a vampire) can be affected, but a creature with no blood is immune.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The target takes full damage and is [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d10`.

# Stumbling Curse *Focus 1*   
[curse](../../Rules/traits/curse.md)  [hex](../../Rules/traits/hex-apg.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [witch](../../Rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Reflex
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

With a twist of a finger, you send a creature careening on a haphazard trajectory. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes a â€“2 status penalty to [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) and [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks.
> - **Failure** As success, and each time the target [Strides](../../Rules/actions/stride.md), it uses the first 5 feet of movement of the [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) to move 5 feet in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except you control the direction of the target's first 5 feet of movement of the [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md).

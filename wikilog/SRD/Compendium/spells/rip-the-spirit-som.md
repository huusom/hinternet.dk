# Rip The Spirit *Spell 5*   
[death](../../Rules/traits/death.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 living creature
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes `5d6` negative damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained) if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when [Casting the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).

**[>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (somatic)** The spell targets one living creature in range.

**[>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is `10d6` negative instead of `5d6`.

**[>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of damage increases by `1d6`, or by `2d6` for the 2-action version.

[divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [scrying](../../Rules/traits/scrying.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Duration**10 minutes

You create an [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) floating ear at a location within range (even if it's outside your line of sight or line of effect). It can't move, but you can hear through the ear as if using your normal auditory senses.

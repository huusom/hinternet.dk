# Radiant Field *Spell 2*   
[evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [light](../../Rules/traits/light.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)

- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst

You create an area of bright light. Creatures with light blindness (Bestiary 343) that are [blinded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by radiant field and remain in the area must attempt a Fortitude save at the start of their turns. On a failure, a creature remains [blinded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round; this is an [incapacitation](../../Rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect. This spell also suppresses magical darkness of your radiant field spell's level or lower.

**Heightened (4th)** Creatures seen through the area are [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures with light blindness, even those that are outside the area.

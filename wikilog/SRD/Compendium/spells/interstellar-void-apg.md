You call upon the frigid depths of outer space to bring a terrible chill to your enemy. The target is cloaked in the freezing void, which deals `3d6` cold damage immediately and the first time each round you [Sustain the Spell](../../Rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) on future turns, with a basic Fortitude save.

The target is [fatigued](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) for as long as the effect persists.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `1d6`.

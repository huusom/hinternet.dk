# Acid Arrow *Spell 2*   
[acid](../../Rules/traits/acid.md)  [attack](../../Rules/traits/attack.md)  [evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You conjure an arrow of acid that continues corroding the target after it hits. Make a spell attack against the target.

On a hit, you deal `3d8` acid damage plus `1d6` [persistent acid damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The initial damage increases by 2d8, and the [persistent acid damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1d6.

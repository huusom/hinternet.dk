# Lament *Focus 1*   
[auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Domains**: [[sorrow](../setting/domains.md#Sorrow)]
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30-foot cone
- **Targets**1 or more creatures
- **Saving Throw**  basic Will

You let out your negative emotions in a guttural wail that shakes your enemies' hearts and deals `1d8` mental damage (basic Will save). If you have any harmful conditions imposed by [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effects, lament deals additional mental damage equal to the counteract level of the highest-level effect.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.

# Winning Streak *Spell 4*   
[divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**20 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 round (see text)

The target is energized by its good fortune as it spreads to othersâ€”as long as they keep winning. It gains the [quickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition for 1 round. If the target or one of their allies within 20 feet gets a critical success on an attack roll against a significant foe, whoever got the critical success becomes [quickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Quickened) if they weren't already, and the duration of the winning streak is extended by another round. Creatures [quickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Quickened) by the spell can use the extra action to [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md), or [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md). If a full round passes without the target or one their allies critically succeeding on an attack roll against a significant foe, the winning streak breaks and the spell ends.

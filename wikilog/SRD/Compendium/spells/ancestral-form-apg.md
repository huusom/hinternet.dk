- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You take the form of your ancestral spirits, becoming [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and quasi-corporeal. You gain resistance 10 to all damage (except force and damage from [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with the ghost touch property rune), and this resistance is doubled against non-magical and precision damage. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed; when Flying, moving upward isn't difficult terrain for you. You can't move through solid objects, but you can float through tiny gaps. You can't [Cast Spells](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) (but you can Sustain a Spell), activate items, or use actions that have the [attack](../../Rules/traits/attack.md) or [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 5.

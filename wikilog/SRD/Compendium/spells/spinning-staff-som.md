[evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [magus](../../Rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Requirements**You're wielding a staff.

You spin your staff with a twirling flourish, attacking two foes and transforming the momentum into magical energy to charge for your next [Spellstrike](../../Rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with your staff against one foe and then a second melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with your staff against a different foe. Your multiple attack penalty applies to both of these attacks as normal.

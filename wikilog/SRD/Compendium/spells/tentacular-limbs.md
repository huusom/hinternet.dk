# Tentacular Limbs *Focus 1*   
[morph](../../Rules/traits/morph.md)  [sorcerer](../../Rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Your arms turn into long, pliable tentacles, increasing your reach when you're delivering touch range spells and making unarmed [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with your arms (such as fist and claw [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md)) to 10 feet. This doesn't change the reach of your melee weapon attacks. During the duration, whenever you [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can add an additional action to that spell's casting to temporarily extend your reach to 20 feet to deliver that spell.

**Heightened (+ 2)** When you add an additional action to a spell to temporarily extend your reach, your reach increases by an additional 10 feet to deliver that spell.

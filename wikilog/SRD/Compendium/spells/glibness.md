# Glibness *Spell 4*   
[enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**10 minutes

Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. You gain a +4 status bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](../../Rules/actions/lie.md) and against [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to discern if you are telling the truth, and you add your level even if you're untrained. If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that penalty or increase by half.

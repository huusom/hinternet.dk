# Loose Time's Arrow *Spell 2*   
[transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**up to 6 creatures
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

You pluck the time stream like a bowâ€”pull one string back, release, and watch a creature fly. All affected targets are [quickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Quickened). They can use the extra action only to [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) or [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md).

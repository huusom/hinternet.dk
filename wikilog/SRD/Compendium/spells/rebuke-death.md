- **Domains**: [[healing](../setting/domains.md#Healing)]
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Area**20-foot emanation
- **Targets**1 living creature per action spent to cast this spell

You snatch creatures from the jaws of death. You can spend 1 to 3 actions [Casting this Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains `3d6` Hit Points. If the target had the [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition, coming back from [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) due to this healing doesn't increase its [wounded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the healing by `1d6`.

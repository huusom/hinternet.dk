# Jump *Spell 1*   
[move](../../Rules/traits/move.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

Your legs surge with strength, ready to leap high and far. You jump 30 feet in any direction without touching the ground. You must land on a space of solid ground within 30 feet of you, or else you fall after using your next action.

**Heightened (3rd)** The range becomes touch, the target changes to one touched creature, and the duration becomes 1 minute, allowing the target to jump as described whenever it takes the [Leap](../../Rules/actions/leap.md) action.

# Ectoplasmic Expulsion *Spell 5*   
[mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You call upon tendrils of ephemeral ectoplasm to pass through the target and carry away a harmful psychic affliction.

You immediately attempt to counteract a single effect on the target with the [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) or [possession](../../Rules/traits/possession.md) trait, or an effect giving the target the [controlled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Controlled) or [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) condition. If you fail to counteract the effect, you nevertheless set up a resonance that allows the target to more ably escape the effect on its own; for the next hour, the target gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves to shrug off the effect you failed to counteract (such as Will saves to shake off control by the [possession](possession.md) spell).

# Eclipse Burst *Spell 7*   
[cold](../../Rules/traits/cold.md)  [darkness](../../Rules/traits/darkness.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Area**60-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

A globe of freezing darkness explodes in the area, dealing `8d10` cold damage to creatures in the area, plus `8d4` additional negative damage to living creatures. Creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

If the globe overlaps with an area of magical light or affects a creature affected by magical light, eclipse burst attempts to counteract the [light](../../Rules/traits/light.md) effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature or object is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature or object takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature or object takes full damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature or object takes double damage. If it's a creature, it becomes [blinded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by the darkness for an unlimited duration.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `1d10` and the negative damage against the living increases by `1d4`.

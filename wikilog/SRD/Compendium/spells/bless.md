# Bless *Spell 1*   
[enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**5-foot emanation
- **Targets**you and allies in the area

Blessings from beyond help your companions strike true.

You and your allies in the area gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast [bless](), you can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. Bless can counteract bane.

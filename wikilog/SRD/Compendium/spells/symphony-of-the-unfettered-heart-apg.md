# Symphony Of The Unfettered Heart *Focus 5*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [bard](../../Rules/traits/bard.md)  [composition](../../Rules/traits/composition.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**you or 1 ally

Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns.

Attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check to counteract one of the following conditions affecting the target: [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](../../Rules/conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Restrained), [slowed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Slowed), or [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned). If you fail, you can't target that effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) DC for [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed)).

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to four creatures.

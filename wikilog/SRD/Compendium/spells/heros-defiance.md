# Hero's Defiance *Focus 10*   
[champion](../../Rules/traits/champion.md)  [healing](../../Rules/traits/healing.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [positive](../../Rules/traits/positive.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 
- **Trigger**An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.

You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing.

Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover `10d4+20` Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) or [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying).

Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use hero's defiance again until you [Refocus](../../Rules/actions/refocus.md) or the next time you prepare.

Hero's defiance cannot be used against effects with the [death](../../Rules/traits/death.md) trait or that would leave no remains, such as [disintegrate](disintegrate.md).

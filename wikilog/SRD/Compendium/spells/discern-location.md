# Discern Location *Spell 8*   
[detection](../../Rules/traits/detection.md)  [divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- **Range**unlimited
- **Targets**1 creature or object

You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence.

You can target a creature only if you've seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. Discern location automatically overcomes protections against detection and divination of lower level than this spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it.

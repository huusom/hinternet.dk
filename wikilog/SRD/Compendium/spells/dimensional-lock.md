[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)

- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**60-foot burst

You create a shimmering barrier that attempts to counteract [teleportation](../../Rules/traits/teleportation.md) effects and planar travel into or out of the area, including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces (such as a bag of holding). Dimensional lock tries to counteract any attempt to summon a creature into the area but doesn't stop the creature from departing when the summoning ends.

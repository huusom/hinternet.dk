- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

You surround a foe in a swirling storm of violent winds, roiling clouds, and crackling lightning. The storm deals `1d12` electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the target also is [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round and takes 1 [persistent electricity damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d12`, and the [persistent electricity damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a failure increases by 1.

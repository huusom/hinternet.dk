[curse](../../Rules/traits/curse.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md), [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target becomes [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened). Reducing its [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition to 0 ends the curse.
> - **Failure** The target becomes [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and can't reduce its [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by remove curse or similar magic. Whenever the target is [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened) and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also [slowed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Slowed).
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened).

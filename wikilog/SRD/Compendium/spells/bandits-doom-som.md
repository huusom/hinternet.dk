# Bandit's Doom *Spell 5*   
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [curse](../../Rules/traits/curse.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** 30 minutes 
- **Targets**1 item of 2 Bulk or less
- **Duration**1 month

You ward the target item against those who would steal it. When a creature attempts to take the target into its possession, it takes `8d8` mental damage and is [doomed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Doomed), depending on the result of its Will save. The spell then ends. You can choose up to 10 creatures when you cast this spell; if you do, those creatures can take the target item without triggering the ward. You can only have one bandit's doom active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the newer casting supersedes the older.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage and is [doomed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Doomed).
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [doomed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Doomed).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [doomed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Doomed).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `2d8`.

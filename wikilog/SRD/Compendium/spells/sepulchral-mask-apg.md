You manifest a supernatural funerary mask, granting you a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws against [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effects for 1 minute. Its somber countenance forces your foes to confront their regrets and sins. Each enemy in the area when you [Cast the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) or that starts its turn in the area takes `1d4` mental damage and must attempt a Will save.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and a –1 status penalty to Will saves against [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effects for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 2)** Increase the mental damage by `2d4` and the emanation's radius by 5 feet.

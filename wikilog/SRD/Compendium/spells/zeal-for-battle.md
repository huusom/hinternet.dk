[cleric](../../Rules/traits/cleric.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[zeal](../setting/domains.md#Zeal)]
- **Cast** [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You and at least 1 ally are about to roll initiative.
- **Range**10 foot
- **Targets**you and the triggering ally

You stoke the righteous anger within yourself and an ally. You and the target ally each roll a d20 and use the higher result for both your initiative rolls. You each still use your own [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) modifier or other statistic to determine your results.

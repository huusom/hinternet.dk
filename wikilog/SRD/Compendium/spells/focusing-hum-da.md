# Focusing Hum *Spell 3*   
[divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Area**15-foot emanation centered on you
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any flat check to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) while [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) for creatures within the area is 2 lower. [Confused](../../Rules/conditions.md#Confused) creatures in the area don't attack anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to speak coherently. You take a â€“2 penalty to [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](../../Rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](../../Rules/actions/sneak.md).

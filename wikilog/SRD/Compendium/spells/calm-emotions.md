You forcibly calm creatures in the area, soothing them into a nonviolent state; each creature must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** Calming urges impose a â€“1 status penalty to the creature's attack rolls.
> - **Failure** Any [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effects that would affect the creature are suppressed and the creature can't use [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) actions. If the target is subject to hostility from any other creature, it ceases to be affected by calm emotions.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but hostility doesn't end the effect.

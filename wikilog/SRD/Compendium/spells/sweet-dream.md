With soothing song or tales, you lull the target into an enchanting dream. When you cast the spell, the target falls [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) if it wasn't already. While [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), it experiences a dream of your choice. If it sleeps for at least 1 minute, it gains the benefit of the dream for the remainder of the spell's duration.

You conjure four types of elementals who combine forces to form into a chaotic storm. The confluence has AC 28 and 120 Hit Points, weakness 10 to area effects, and immunity to bleed and poison. Creatures can move through the confluence; creatures within the confluence are [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed), and all creatures outside the confluence are [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it. When you Cast or Sustain this Spell, you choose up to two different types of elementals to act.

- **Air** ([air](../../Rules/traits/air.md), [electricity](../../Rules/traits/electricity.md)) The elemental looses a bolt of electricity from the confluence, dealing `4d4` electricity damage to creatures within 20 feet of the confluence, with a basic Reflex save. This doesn't affect creatures that are completely inside of the confluence.
- **Earth** ([earth](../../Rules/traits/earth.md)) The confluence gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and resistance 10 to all physical damage (except adamantine) for 1 round.
- **Fire** ([fire](../../Rules/traits/fire.md)) Flames roar through the confluence, dealing `1d6` [persistent fire damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to those partially or entirely inside the confluence.
- **Water** ([attack](../../Rules/traits/attack.md), [water](../../Rules/traits/water.md)) The elemental expels a powerful jet of water. Attempt a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet of the confluence, using your spell attack roll modifier. This attack ignores concealment granted by the confluence, and the elemental gets a +2 circumstance bonus on the spell attack roll against a target inside the confluence.
- The water deals `4d6` bludgeoning damage on a hit (doubled on a critical hit). This attack doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.

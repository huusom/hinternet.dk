You utter phrases in an unknown tongue, assaulting the minds of those nearby. Each target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of its save, each target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute. You can increase the number of actions it takes to [Cast the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) (to a maximum of 3 actions total). For each additional action, increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet, to a maximum of 10 extra feet for 3 actions.

> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied).
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [confused](../../Rules/conditions.md#Confused).

**Heightened (+ 3)** The initial radius increases by 5 feet.

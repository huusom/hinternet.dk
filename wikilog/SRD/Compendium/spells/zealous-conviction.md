# Zealous Conviction *Spell 6*   
[emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**up to 10 willing creatures
- **Duration**10 minutes

You bypass your targets' rational minds, instilling them with unshakable conviction and zeal. The targets each gain 12 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to Will saves against [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) effects, as their faith overrides the signals from their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something, it must comply with your request, though if it would normally find the task repugnant, it can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On a success, it ends the spell's effects on itself entirely.

**Heightened (9th)** The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and the status bonus to Will saves increases to +3.

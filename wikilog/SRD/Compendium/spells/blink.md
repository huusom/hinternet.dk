- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You gain resistance 5 to all damage (except force). You can [Sustain the Spell](../../Rules/actions/sustain-a-spell.md) to vanish and reappear 10 feet away in a random direction determined by the GM; the movement doesn't trigger reactions. At the end of your turn, you vanish and reappear as above.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 3.

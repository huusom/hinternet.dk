# Charitable Urge *Spell 2*   
[enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](../../Rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You speak on the virtue of charity, compelling the target to give away its possessions. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target has no items on its person, the spell fails.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) as it wrestles with the urge.
> - **Failure** On its next turn, before it does anything else, the target must present the nearest creature with an item in its possession; the target chooses which item to give, and if the only item it has is one that it's currently using to defend itself, such as a weapon during a combat encounter, it can choose to be [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round instead of giving up the item. This might require the target to [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) to retrieve an item or move to reach the nearest creature, and handing the item to the target always requires an [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) action.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and the target must repeat the effects of failure on each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, ending it entirely on a critical success.

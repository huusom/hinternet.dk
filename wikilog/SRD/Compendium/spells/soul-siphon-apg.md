You siphon off a portion of the target's soul to bolster your own vitality. The target must attempt a Fortitude save or take `1d4` negative damage. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the total amount of HP the target loses, including the HP lost from becoming [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained).

> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and becomes [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained).

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by `1d4`.

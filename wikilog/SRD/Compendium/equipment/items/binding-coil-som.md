This talisman, a bright red coil that's warm to the touch and faintly resembles a serpent, wraps entirely around your weapon. When you activate this talisman's effect, attempt to [Grapple](../../../Rules/actions/grapple.md) the creature you hit. On a success, rather than the normal [Grapple](../../../Rules/traits/grapple.md) effects, the coil instead wraps itself around the target with one end remaining attached to your weapon.

Your opponent must succeed at a DC 20 [Escape](../../../Rules/actions/escape.md) check to break free. The coil breaks if you move any further away from the bound opponent, but not if you move any closer.

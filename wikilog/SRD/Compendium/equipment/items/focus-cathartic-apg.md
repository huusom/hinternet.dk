Focus briefly calms your neurons, helping ease [mental](../../../Rules/traits/mental.md) effects.

When you drink this elixir, the elixir attempts a counteract check with the listed counteract modifier to remove the [confused](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Confused) or [stupefied](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC.

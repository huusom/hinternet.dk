This item appears to be and functions as a bag of holding, but is actually a feeding orifice of a bizarre extradimensional creature. Any animal or vegetable matter put in the bag has a chance of triggering the bag's interest. Whenever you reach into the bag to retrieve an item or place an animal or plant.

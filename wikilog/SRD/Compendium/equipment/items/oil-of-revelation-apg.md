This bright oil, first created by humans as a tool to help them fight in darkness, holds flecks of tiny gemstones in suspension and smells like a struck tindertwig.

The first time a weapon coated with this oil damages a creature, the wound glows with light for 1 minute. If the creature is [invisible](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible), the light's position means it is merely [hidden](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than [undetected](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected). The light also negates the [concealed](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn't damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power.

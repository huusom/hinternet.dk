This +2 adamantine scale mail appears to have a fortification rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically hit, after taking damage, you become [petrified](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 round.

Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses to you.

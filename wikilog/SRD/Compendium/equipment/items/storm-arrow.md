The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper.

When an activated storm arrow hits a target, it is buffeted by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals `3d12` electricity damage and the target must attempt a DC 25 Reflex saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon with a shock property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though the attack doesn't benefit from the shock property rune itself.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The foe is unaffected.
> - **Success** The foe takes half damage and isn't affected by the wind.
> - **Failure** The foe takes full damage and is buffeted by winds for 1 round, taking a –2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its fly Speed.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the foe takes double damage.

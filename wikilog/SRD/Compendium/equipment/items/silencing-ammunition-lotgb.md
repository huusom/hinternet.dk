Silencing ammunition is particularly dense and seems to dampen sounds around it. On a successful [Strike](../../../Rules/actions/strike.md), an activated piece of silencing ammunition creates a 2nd-level [silence](../../spells/silence.md) effect on the target. The target can resist the effects of the ammunition with a successful DC 25 Will save, though it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty if the [Strike](../../../Rules/actions/strike.md) was a critical hit. While the effect is active, the target can use an [Interact](../../../Rules/actions/interact.md) action to try to tug out the arrow or bolt and end the effect early; this requires a successful DC 25 Will save.

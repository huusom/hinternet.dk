A faint mist emanates from your skin, making you [concealed](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) for the listed duration. As usual being [concealed](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) when your position is still obvious, you can't use this concealment to [Hide](../../../Rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](../../../Rules/actions/sneak.md).

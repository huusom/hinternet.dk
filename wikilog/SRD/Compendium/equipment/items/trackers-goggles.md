These lenses of forest-green glass are bound in rough leather stitched with crude twine. While wearing these goggles, you gain a +1 bonus to [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) checks to [Sense Direction](../../../Rules/actions/sense-direction.md) and [Track](../../../Rules/actions/track.md). If you fail a check to [Track](../../../Rules/actions/track.md), you can try again after 30 minutes rather than an hour.

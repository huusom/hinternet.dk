This nugget of gold and lead amalgam is attached to the weapon by thick, twisted wire or chain. When activated, the target's limbs become like lead weights. For 2 rounds, each time the target Strides it must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed for that [Stride](../../../Rules/actions/stride.md) (to a minimum Speed of 5 feet). On a critical success, the dupe's gold nugget effect ends early.

# Hunter's Bane *Item 2*  
[consumable](../../../Rules/traits/consumable.md)  [divination](../../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [magical](../../../Rules/traits/magical.md)  [talisman](../../../Rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 6 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** An [undetected](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected) enemy hits you with an attack; **Requirements** You are trained in [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival).
- **Category** Talisman

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven leaves. When you activate the hunter's bane, you sense the exact location of the attacker, making it [hidden](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you instead of [undetected](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected). If the attacker is behind lead, the hunter's bane fails and is wasted.

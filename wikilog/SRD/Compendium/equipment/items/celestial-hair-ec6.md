[abjuration](../../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [consumable](../../../Rules/traits/consumable.md)  [magical](../../../Rules/traits/magical.md)  [rare](../../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  [talisman](../../../Rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 12500 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** [Interact](../../../Rules/actions/interact.md); **Trigger** You critically fail a saving throw or are critically hit by an attack.
- **Category** Talisman

This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note. The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will saving throw or be [enfeebled](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) and [stupefied](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) until the end of its next turn.

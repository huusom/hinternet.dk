This rose-gold ring is adorned in the center by a somewhat ominous-looking horned skull.

This ring gives you the power to cast the following innate arcane cantrips any number of times each day: detect magic, mage hand, and prestidigitation. Each is cast as a 1st-level spell.

If you are an arcane spellcaster, these can instead be heightened to the level of your cantrips.

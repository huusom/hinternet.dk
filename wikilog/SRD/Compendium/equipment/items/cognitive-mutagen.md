- **Activate** [Interact](../../../Rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Elixir

Your mind becomes clear and cognition flows freely, but physical matters seem ephemeral.

**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to [Arcana](../../skills.md#Arcana), [Crafting](../../skills.md#Crafting), [Lore](../../skills.md#Lore), [Occultism](../../skills.md#Occultism), and [Society](../../skills.md#Society) checks and all checks to [Recall Knowledge](../../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md). Your critical failures on [Recall Knowledge](../../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) checks become failures instead.

**Drawback** You take a â€“2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) checks, and [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming [encumbered](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Encumbered), and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4.

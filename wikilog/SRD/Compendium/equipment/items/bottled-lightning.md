Bottled lightning is packed with volatile reagents that create a blast of electricity when they are exposed to air. Bottled lightning deals the listed electricity damage and electricity splash damage. On a hit, the target becomes [flat-footed](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn. Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls.

# Glittering Snare *Item 4*  
[consumable](../../../Rules/traits/consumable.md)  [mechanical](../../../Rules/traits/mechanical.md)  [snare](../../../Rules/traits/snare.md)  [trap](../../../Rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](../../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  [visual](../../../Rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Price** 18 gp
- **Category** Snare

[Small](../../../Rules/traits/small-b1.md) flecks of mica, sand, and ground glass are packed into a spring-loaded canister that can be rigged to a trip wire or [hidden](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in a container. The first creature to enter the square or open the container must attempt a DC 20 Reflex save as the area is showered with bright, glittering dust that sticks to skin, fur, and clothing.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks for 1 minute or until it uses an [Interact](../../../Rules/actions/interact.md) action to remove the glitter.
> - **Failure** The creature takes a –2 status penalty to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks for 2 minutes or until it spends a 2-action activity, which has the [manipulate](../../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to remove the glitter. If the creature was [invisible](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible), the glitter outlines it for 1 round, making it [concealed](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) rather than [undetected](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to visual senses.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the penalty is –4. The glitter sticks for 5 minutes or until the creature spends a 3-action activity, which has the [manipulate](../../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, to remove it. The glitter continues to fall around the creature until completely removed, leaving a trail behind it as it moves and revealing its rough location; the creature is [hidden](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden), rather than [undetected](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected), to any creature that can see the glitter whenever it would otherwise have been [undetected](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected).

When lit, this black candle's eerie blue flame reveals the presence of [invisible](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures. Within a 10-foot radius of the lit candle, creatures don't benefit from the [invisible](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition. Their bodies are outlined, not fully visible, so they are [concealed](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed). Once lit, the candle burns for 1 minute, after which the effect ends. If extinguished, it can't be relit.

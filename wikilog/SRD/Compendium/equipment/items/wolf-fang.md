This wolf canine is bound in a strip of leather and tied to a buckle or strap of a suit of armor. When you activate the fang, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier to the target of your [Trip](../../../Rules/actions/trip.md). If your [Trip](../../../Rules/actions/trip.md) would already deal physical damage that doesn't include an ability modifier, add your Strength modifier to that damage.

This crooked staff is made from twisting acacia wood and has a sphere of rough sandstone embedded in the top, to channel the magic of the desert. When wielding this staff in deserts, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) checks to [Subsist](../../../Rules/actions/subsist.md), [Track](../../../Rules/actions/track.md), and [Cover Tracks](../../../Rules/actions/cover-tracks.md).

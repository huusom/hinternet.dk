A galvasphere animates a corpse to motion via electricity, rather than necromancy. When you Activate the galvasphere by inserting it into an adjacent intact Medium or Small humanoid corpse, the corpse animates as a galvaheart zombie for 1 minute. The galvaheart zombie has the statistics of a zombie shambler except that it is a [construct](../../../Rules/traits/construct.md) instead of an [undead](../../../Rules/traits/undead.md), isn't [evil](../../../Rules/traits/evil.md), can't be harmed by positive energy, and is the same size as the corpse (Medium or Small). The zombie is your [minion](../../../Rules/traits/minion.md) and performs the actions you choose when you [Command](../../../Rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) it. If you don't [Command](../../../Rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) it, it takes no action, twitching in place as the electricity that animates it slowly expends itself.

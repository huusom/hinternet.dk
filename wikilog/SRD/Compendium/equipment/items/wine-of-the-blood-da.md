This wine, prepared using the blood of a creature with overwhelming vitality, soothes the body, mind, and spirit with a temporary sense of euphoria and rest. When you drink wine of the blood, you recover `2d10` Hit Points.

Additionally, the wine attempts to counteract every negative [emotion](../../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effect affecting you, with a counteract level of 3 and a counteract modifier of +9. Lastly, you gain a +1 status bonus to all Will saves, or a +2 status bonus against [emotion](../../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effects, for 1 minute.

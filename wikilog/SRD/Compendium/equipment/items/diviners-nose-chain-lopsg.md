The diviner's nose chain is worn by attaching piercings to the ear and nose, creating a connection between the senses of hearing and smell. The diviner's nose chain grants you [scent](../../../Rules/abilities/scent.md) out to 30 feet as an imprecise sense, and a +1 item bonus to checks to [Seek](../../../Rules/actions/seek.md) or [Sense Motive](../../../Rules/actions/sense-motive.md).

Eroding bullets cast a faint green glow, and smell like the sicklysweet organic gases that rise from corpses. Handling an eroding bullet without gloves deals 1 point of acid damage and leaves the putrid scent coated on your fingers. Upon Striking an enemy, the glass casing inside the bullet bursts, releasing a splattering of bubbling green acid that coats the target. The target takes `2d6` [persistent acid damage](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) in addition to the damage normally dealt by the attack.

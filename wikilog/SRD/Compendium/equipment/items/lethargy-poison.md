Lethargy poison is commonly used in hit-and-run tactics by drow and others who want their victims alive; the ambusher retreats until the poison sets in and the victim falls [unconscious](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). Further exposure to lethargy poison does not require the target to attempt additional saving throws; only failing an saving throw against an ongoing exposure can progress its stage.

This kobold wire is thin and hard to see, making it perfect for an ambush. The wielder wraps the wire around a vulnerable spot, such as the neck, and twists it to inflict potentially fatal lacerations. The name derives from the use of a similar wire in traps, or slow fangs, with the word "slow" removed, as a fangwire gets quick results.

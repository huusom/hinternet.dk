- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You take damage from a physical attack while you don't have the affixed shield raised.
- **Category** Talisman

This clear quartz cabochon attaches to the center of your shield. When you activate the cabochon, you use the [Shield Block](../../feats/shield-block.md) reaction even if you hadn't raised the affixed shield (and even if you don't normally have that reaction).

A bane rune causes a weapon to grant you improved understanding of creatures of a particular type, allowing you to deal more damage to those creatures. The crafter chooses [aberration](../../../Rules/traits/aberration.md), [animal](../../../Rules/traits/animal.md), [beast](../../../Rules/traits/beast.md), [celestial](../../../Rules/traits/celestial.md), [construct](../../../Rules/traits/construct.md), [dragon](../../../Rules/traits/dragon.md), [elemental](../../../Rules/traits/elemental.md), [fey](../../../Rules/traits/fey.md), [fiend](../../../Rules/traits/fiend.md), [giant](../../../Rules/traits/giant.md), [monitor](../../../Rules/traits/monitor.md), [ooze](../../../Rules/traits/ooze.md), or both [fungus](../../../Rules/traits/fungus-b1.md) and [plant](../../../Rules/traits/plant.md). The weapon deals `1d6` additional damage of the weapon's damage type to creatures with the chosen trait or traits. The benefit doesn't apply against creatures of the chosen type disguised as other creatures. It's up to GM discretion whether the bane rune applies against a creature disguised as a creature of the chosen type.

The GM might allow bane runes for other creature traits, such as [astral](../../../Rules/traits/astral-b1.md), [dream](../../../Rules/traits/dream-b2.md), or [demon](../../../Rules/traits/demon.md). However, [humanoids](../../../Rules/traits/humanoid.md), [undead](../../../Rules/traits/undead.md), and specific types of [humanoids](../../../Rules/traits/humanoid.md) (such as [elves](../../../Rules/traits/elf.md)) are never a valid option.

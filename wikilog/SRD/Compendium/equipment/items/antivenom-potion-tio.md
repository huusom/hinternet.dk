This cloudy, white liquid helps protect against poisons.

When you drink an antivenom potion, you can immediately attempt a DC 10 flat check to end any [persistent poison damage](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) you're taking. In addition, for 1 minute after drinking the potion, you gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking [persistent poison damage](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

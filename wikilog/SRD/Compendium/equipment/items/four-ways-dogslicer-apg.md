This +2 striking dogslicer is obviously the work of a brilliant but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over safety. Four toothy gems line the blade's cutting edge, three of which glow—one with fiery red light, one with a chill blue, and one that gives off sparks—while the last is a glistening black. Each of these gems embodies a weapon property rune, but only one rune can be active at a time.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You twist the gem along the blade corresponding with the desired weapon rune: red for flaming, blue for frost, or yellow for shock. You take `1d6` damage of the type the chosen rune deals. You can instead twist the black gem to disable the active property rune, taking no damage.

This shimmering paste has many properties of a [shield](../../spells/shield.md) spell.

When you slather it onto a creature or object, the target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round. The first time a physical attack or a magic missile hits the target during that round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and then the oil's effect ends.

You cease aging, and if you were older than young adult in age, you become a young adult again. You gain a +4 status bonus to saves against [death](../../../Rules/traits/death.md) effects and resistance to negative damage equal to half your level. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can recite a mandatory appearance clause in your Thrune contract as a 3-action activity to summon you to her side, where you are [controlled](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Controlled) by Abrogail for 1 minute before you return.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You recite a hold harmless provision from your Thrune contract. Reduce your [doomed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Doomed) value to 0. Abrogail Thrune II is immediately made aware that you have used this ability.
```

Sharp metal jaws wind tightly into the pressure plate mechanism of this snare. When triggered, the jaws clamp shut and spin, damaging limbs in the process. The snare deals `10d8` piercing damage to the first creature to enter the square; that creature must attempt a DC 33 Reflex save.

> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage plus `4d6` [persistent bleed damage](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and it becomes [clumsy](../../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 minute.

# Fiendripping Blast Trap *Hazard 7*  
[mechanical](../../../Rules/traits/mechanical.md)  [trap](../../../Rules/traits/trap.md)  [uncommon](../../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 25 expert  

A blast of energy damages all creatures within 20 feet, with particularly severe damage to [fiends](../../../Rules/traits/fiend.md).

- **Disable** [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) DC 27 (expert) to identify the proper sequence of buttons in the divots, or [dispel magic](../../spells/dispel-magic.md) (4th level; counteract DC 25) to suppress the [magical](../../../Rules/traits/magical.md) effect for 1 hour.

title: Forceful Blast [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[divine](../../../rules/traits/divine.md)  [evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  

- **Trigger**: The door is touched without first pressing the correct sequence of buttons

**Effect** A blast of energy ripples outward from the door, dealing `4d10` force damage to all creatures within 20 feet and forcing them to make a DC 25 Fortitude save. [Fiends](../../../rules/traits/fiend.md) treat the result of their saving throw as one degree worse.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened); while it is [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened), it's also [slowed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Slowed).

**Reset** The trap resets after 1 hour.

# Unwavering Mien  *Feat 1*  
[elf](../../Rules/traits/elf.md)  


Your mystic control and meditations allow you to resist external influences upon your consciousness. Whenever you are affected by a [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) effect that lasts at least 2 rounds, you can reduce the duration by 1 round.

You still require natural sleep, but you treat your saving throws against effects that would cause you to fall asleep as one degree of success better. This protects only against [sleep](../../Rules/traits/sleep.md) effects, not against other forms of falling [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).

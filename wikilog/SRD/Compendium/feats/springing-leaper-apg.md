# Springing Leaper  *Feat 5*  
[catfolk](../../Rules/traits/catfolk-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

Your powerful legs allow you to make sudden and dramatic leaps. You can [Leap](../../Rules/actions/leap.md) as a 2-action activity to double the distance you can [Leap](../../Rules/actions/leap.md) vertically, or [Leap](../../Rules/actions/leap.md) as a 3-action activity to triple the distance you can [Leap](../../Rules/actions/leap.md) vertically. You don't automatically fail [Long Jumps](../../Rules/actions/long-jump.md) for jumping in a different direction than your [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md).

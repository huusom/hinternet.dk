[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You dive into the fray before rewinding yourself to safety. [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against that enemy. You then teleport back to the square from which you began your Reversing Charge. You can use Reversing Charge while [Burrowing](../../Rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../Rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../Rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

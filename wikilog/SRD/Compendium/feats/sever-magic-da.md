# Sever Magic  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 16*  
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md)  [esoterica](../../Rules/traits/esoterica-da.md)  [thaumaturge](../../Rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're holding an implement.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You apply a frayed thread, a pinch of fulu ash, or a similar undone charm to your weapon, and swing to break a spell. Make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy. If you hit and deal damage, you attempt to counteract a single spell active on the target (your choice). Your counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC â€“ 10.

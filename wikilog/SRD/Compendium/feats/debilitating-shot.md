[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Aiming for a weak point, you impede your foe with a precise shot. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). If it hits and deals damage, the target is [slowed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of its next turn.

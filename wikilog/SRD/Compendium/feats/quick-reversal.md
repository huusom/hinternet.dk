# Quick Reversal  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  [press](../../Rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are flanked by at least two enemies.
- **Activity** Single Action

You turn your foes' flanking against them with a quick reverse. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against one of the flanking enemies and make a second [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with the same weapon or unarmed attack against a different enemy that is flanking you. This second [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) has the same multiple attack penalty of the initial attack and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.

# Eagle Eyes  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)

You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither of you is [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden), [undetected](../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected), or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.

# Envenom Strike  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 9*  
[nagaji](../../Rules/traits/nagaji-loil.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: you possess a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) from a nagaji heritage or ancestry feat that deals poison damage
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Single Action

You spit venom onto a weapon you're holding or a weapon held by a willing creature within 30 feet; you can also use this ability to envenom your nagaji fangs unarmed attack. If the next [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with the chosen weapon before the start of your next turn hits and deals damage, the [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) deals an additional `2d6` poison damage.

# Psychic Rapport  *Feat 1*  
[psychic](../../Rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  


Your telepathic sensitivity intensifies when you're affected by mental magic, making it easier for you to link to other creatures. After you [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) trait, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy), and [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) checks, and to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](../../Rules/actions/sense-motive.md).

# Dazzling Bullet  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pistol Phenom Dedication](pistol-phenom-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check against the target creature's Will DC and make a ranged firearm [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against that target. If the [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) deals damage to the target creature and you succeed at the [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check, the creature is [dazzled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.

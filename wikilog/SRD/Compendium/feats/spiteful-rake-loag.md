# Spiteful Rake  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 13*  
[changeling](../../Rules/traits/changeling-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: claw unarmed attack
- **Requirements**: You have both hands free.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your instincts sing of spite and malice, and you've learned a devastating trick: go for the eyes. You make a claw [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, the target is [dazzled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead [blinded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [dazzled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) until restored to maximum hit points.

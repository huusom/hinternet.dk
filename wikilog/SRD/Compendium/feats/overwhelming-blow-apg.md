# Overwhelming Blow  [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 16*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Activity** Three-Action

You throw your weight into a powerful attack that leaves you vulnerable. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). This counts as three attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you get a critical hit. If you roll a critical hit, your attack also gains the [deadly <d12>](../../Rules/traits/deadly.md) trait. Whether or not you hit, you become [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and are [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn.

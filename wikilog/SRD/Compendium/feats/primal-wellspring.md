[druid](../../Rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Primal Focus](primal-focus.md)

Your reservoir of Focus Points is a deep wellspring. If you have spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you [Refocused](../../Rules/actions/refocus.md), you recover 3 Focus Points when you [Refocus](../../Rules/actions/refocus.md) instead of 1.

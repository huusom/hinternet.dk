# Athletic Might  *Feat 5*  
[orc](../../Rules/traits/orc.md)  


Surviving in [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) terrain has given you a great talent for mobility. Whenever you roll a success on an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](../../Rules/actions/climb.md) or [Swim](../../Rules/actions/swim.md), you get a critical success instead.

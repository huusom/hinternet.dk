# Express Rider  *Feat 1*  
[exploration](../../Rules/traits/exploration.md)  [general](../../Rules/traits/general.md)  [move](../../Rules/traits/move.md)  [skill](../../Rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)

You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground quickly. When calculating your travel speed (Core Rulebook 479) for the day while mounted, you can attempt a [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) check to [Command an Animal](../../Rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) to increase your mount's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount's level or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your mount's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your mount's movement in encounters.

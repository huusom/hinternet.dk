# Burning Spell  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [fire](../../Rules/traits/fire.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Elementalist Dedication](elementalist-dedication-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enhance your spell with elemental fire, causing it to set the target on fire. If the next action you use is to [Cast a non-cantrip Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that deals damage at a single target, the spell deals additional [persistent fire damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the spell level, in addition to its other effects. This has no effect if the spell already deals [persistent fire damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The spell gains the [fire](../../Rules/traits/fire.md) trait.

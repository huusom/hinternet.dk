# Lightless Litheness  *Feat 5*  
[fetchling](../../Rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md)  


Your body is almost as flexible as your shadow. When you critically fail at [Squeezing](../../Rules/actions/squeeze.md), you get a failure instead. Additionally, when you roll a success at an [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) check, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical success, you can [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) instead of [Striding](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) up to 5 feet.

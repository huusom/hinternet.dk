# Disorienting Venom  *Feat 9*  
[anadi](../../Rules/traits/anadi-lome.md)

The venom injected by your fangs disorients your foes. A creature damaged by your anadi venom must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round.

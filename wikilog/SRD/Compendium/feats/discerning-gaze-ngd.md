# Discerning Gaze  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners

You have a sense for when people are lying. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your secret [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](../../Rules/actions/sense-motive.md).

If you use [Sense Motive](../../Rules/actions/sense-motive.md) on a creature you have currently condemned with Harsh Judgment, your GM rolls the [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check twice and takes the higher result (this is a [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md) effect).

# Wild Empathy  *Feat 2*  
[ranger](../../Rules/traits/ranger.md)  


You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](../../Rules/actions/make-an-impression.md) on animals and to make very simple [Requests](../../Rules/actions/request.md) of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.

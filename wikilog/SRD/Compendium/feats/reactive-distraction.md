# Reactive Distraction  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [rogue](../../Rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), [Perfect Distraction](perfect-distraction.md)
- **Trigger** You would be hit by an attack or targeted by an effect, or you are within an effect's area.
- **Requirements**: You have Perfect Distraction ready to use.
- **Activity** Reaction

You reactively switch with your decoy to foil your foe. You use Perfection Distraction, even if you were [observed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Observed), as long as you end the movement of your [Sneak](../../Rules/actions/sneak.md) while [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or in a location with cover or greater cover. Your decoy is targeted by the attack or effect instead of you. In the case of an area effect, if your [Sneak](../../Rules/actions/sneak.md) doesn't move you out of the area, both you and the decoy are targeted by the effect.

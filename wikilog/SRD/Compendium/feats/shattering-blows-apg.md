# Shattering Blows  *Feat 16*  
[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md)  


Your forceful blows shatter objects with ease. While you are [raging](../../Rules/actions/rage.md), your melee [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) ignore 5 points of an object's Hardness. If you have the devastator class feature, you instead ignore 10 points of an object's Hardness.

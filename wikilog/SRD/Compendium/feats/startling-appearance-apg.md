# Startling Appearance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../Rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [vigilante](../../Rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](vigilante-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are completely [unnoticed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unnoticed) by the target creature.
- **Activity** Single Action

You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence.

Make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against your target. That creature is [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against this [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), as normal. If your [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the target remains [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for the rest of your turn and is [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit).

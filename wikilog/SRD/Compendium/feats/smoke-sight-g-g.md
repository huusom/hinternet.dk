# Smoke Sight  *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](../../Rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

You're used to fighting and hiding in a haze of smoke and flame. You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) creature if that creature is [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) only by smoke. When you are [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in smoke, increase the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or 12 if you're [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden).

[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  [psyche](../../Rules/traits/psyche-da.md)  [psychic](../../Rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  [teleportation](../../Rules/traits/teleportation.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Requirements**: You used your most recent action to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

When your [Psyche is Unleashed](../../Rules/actions/unleash-psyche-da.md), each burst of magic you cast also folds space around you, and you travel through one of those folds. You teleport 15 feet to a square you can see.

# Adaptive Vision  *Feat 1*  
[dwarf](../../Rules/traits/dwarf.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

After years of using black powder weaponry in dimly lit spaces, you've become accustomed to dazzling flashes of light and sudden shifts in illumination. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md) effects.

If you roll a success on a saving throw against a [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.

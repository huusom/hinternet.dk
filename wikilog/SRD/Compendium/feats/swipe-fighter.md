# Swipe (Fighter)  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a wide, arcing swing. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) and compare the attack roll result to the AC of up to two foes, each of whom must be within your melee reach and adjacent to each other. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. A Swipe counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty.

If you're using a weapon with the [sweep](../../Rules/traits/sweep.md) trait, its modifier applies to all your Swipe attacks.

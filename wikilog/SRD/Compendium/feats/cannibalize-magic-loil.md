# Cannibalize Magic  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 13*  
[rare](../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fey Influence](fey-influence-loil.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

The fey magic inside of you is a vital part of your body, and you can steal other sources of magic to replenish yours. You can draw power from your magical equipment to replenish your health. You drain one of your invested items, in the process regaining Hit Points equal to double the item's level.

In addition, you can attempt a counteract check with a total bonus equal to 10 + the [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained) item's level against one effect that gave you the [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained), [doomed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Doomed), [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), [fatigued](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fatigued), or [slowed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Slowed) condition. If you succeed, you reduce the chosen condition's value by 1.

An item [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained) by this action becomes non-magical until the next time you make your daily preparations.

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).

# Athletic Strategist  *Feat 2*  
[investigator](../../Rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You know how to calculatedly manipulate joints and body weight. In addition to using [Devise a Stratagem](../../Rules/actions/devise-a-stratagem-apg.md) to modify a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), you can use it to modify a [Disarm](../../Rules/actions/disarm.md), [Grapple](../../Rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md) attempt, substituting your [Devise a Stratagem](../../Rules/actions/devise-a-stratagem-apg.md) roll for the [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check. You must apply the substitution to the first eligible attack you make, whether it's a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) or one of the [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) actions.

You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check when you substitute your [Devise a Stratagem](../../Rules/actions/devise-a-stratagem-apg.md) roll, unless you're using a weapon for the maneuver and the weapon doesn't fit the restrictions for using Intelligence with a stratagem.

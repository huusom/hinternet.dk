[auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [general](../../Rules/traits/general.md)  [linguistic](../../Rules/traits/linguistic.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [skill](../../Rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)

You attempt to reduce panic. Attempt a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check, comparing it to the Will DC of creatures in a 10-foot emanation around you who are [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened). Each of them is temporarily immune for 1 hour.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Reduce the creature's [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value by 2.
> - **Success** Reduce the creature's [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value by 1.

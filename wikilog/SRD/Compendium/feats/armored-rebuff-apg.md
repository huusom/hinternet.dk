# Armored Rebuff  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sentinel Dedication](sentinel-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An adjacent foe critically fails an attack roll to [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.
- **Requirements**: You are wearing medium armor or heavier.
- **Activity** Reaction

You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your foe. Attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md) the triggering foe, even if you don't have a hand free. If you succeed, you can't [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) to follow the foe, as you're knocking the foe back with the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them.

# Lunge  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

Extending your body to its limits, you attack an enemy that would normally be beyond your reach. Make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with a melee weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for that [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). If the weapon has the [disarm](../../Rules/traits/disarm.md), [shove](../../Rules/traits/shove.md), or [trip](../../Rules/traits/trip.md) trait, you can use the corresponding action instead of a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md).

# Bloody Blows  *Feat 5*  
[orc](../../Rules/traits/orc.md)  


Your lethal unarmed attacks leave bloody gouges or cause severe internal bleeding. When you critically hit with a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) using an unarmed attack that isn't [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md), the target takes `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). This can be because you're taking the penalty to use a fist for a lethal attack or because you have an unarmed attack without the [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait due to [Iron Fists](iron-fists-apg.md), [Tusks](tusks-apg.md), or a similar ability.

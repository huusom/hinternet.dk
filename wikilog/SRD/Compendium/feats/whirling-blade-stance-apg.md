# Whirling Blade Stance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Monastic Weaponry](monastic-weaponry.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a mindful stance that creates a deep connection between you and your monk weapons, allowing you to manipulate them with your ki even at a distance. All melee monk weapons you wield with the [finesse](../../Rules/traits/finesse.md) trait gain the [thrown 10 feet](../../Rules/traits/thrown.md) trait (unless they already have the [thrown](../../Rules/traits/thrown.md) trait with a greater range)

Once you've made a thrown [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with such a weapon, you can use the precision of your throw to make additional strikes with it, even from a distance. Start from the space of the previous [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md)'s target to determine the range increment and whether the new target has cover. At the end of your turn, the thrown weapon flies directly back to you in a straight line. If a solid barrier blocks its path, it falls to the ground after hitting the barrier.

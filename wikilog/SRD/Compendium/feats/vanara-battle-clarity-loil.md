# Vanara Battle Clarity  *Feat 13*  
[vanara](../../Rules/traits/vanara-loil.md)  


Your focus in combat is practically unshakable.

While you can act, you aren't [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) to [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden), [undetected](../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected), or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack.

# Warp Likeness  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[morph](../../Rules/traits/morph.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  [reflection](../../Rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Morph-Risen](morph-risen-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Requirements**: You hit a creature with a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) on your last action.
- **Activity** Single Action

You channel some of your own nature through your blow, temporarily warping your target's form to resemble your own. The creature you hit must attempt a Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target resists the effect but its form twists in the process. It's [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The target's body briefly warps to resemble yours. It's [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) until the end of its next turn and [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target's body warps to resemble yours for a significant time. It's [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 minute and [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened).

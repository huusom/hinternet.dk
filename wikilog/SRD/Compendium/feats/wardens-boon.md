[ranger](../../Rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

By pointing out vulnerabilities, you grant the benefits listed in [Hunt Prey](../../Rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) and your hunter's edge benefit to an ally until the end of their next turn. Depending on whether you call out or use gestures, this action gains either the [auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md) trait.

## Warden's Boon leads to...

[Shared Prey](shared-prey.md), [Triple Threat](triple-threat.md)

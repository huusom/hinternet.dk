# Counter Thought  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[abjuration](../../Rules/traits/abjuration.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  [psychic](../../Rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature Casts a Spell with the [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) trait.
- **Requirements**: You have an unexpended spell slot you could use to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

When a foe Casts a Spell that has the [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) trait and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own mental magic to disrupt it. You expend one of your spell slots to counter the triggering creature's casting of a spell with the [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) trait.

You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell; this spell slot must be one for which you could [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with the [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) trait. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell.

# Overwhelming Energy (Sorcerer)  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](../../Rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You alter your spells to overcome resistances. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), the spell ignores an amount of the target's resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the wall created by [wall of fire](../spells/wall-of-fire.md). A creature's immunities are unaffected.

# Double Shot  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon with [reload <0>](../../Rules/traits/reload.md).
- **Activity** Two-Action

You shoot twice in blindingly fast succession. Make two [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), each against a separate target and with a â€“2 penalty. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.

## Double Shot leads to...

[Triple Shot](triple-shot.md), [Multishot Stance](multishot-stance.md)

# Whispering Steps  *Feat 8*

Your spell leaves a lingering connection between you and a creatureâ€”one through which you can nudge the creature's mind this way or that. The amped cantrip must take 2 or more actions to cast, target one or more creatures, and either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip's normal amp entry. Amp Choose one enemy who is a target of the spell. If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you whisper in the creature's mind, forcing it to [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) in a direction of your choosing; as this is forced movement, you can't force the creature to [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) into hazardous terrain, off a ledge, or the like. After it Steps, the creature becomes temporarily immune to this amp for 24 hours.

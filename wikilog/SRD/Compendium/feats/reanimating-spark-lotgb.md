# Reanimating Spark  *Feat 13*  
[poppet](../../Rules/traits/poppet-lotgb.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You have the [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.

The magic that animates you strains to keep you alive.

You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) and [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the [wounded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition as normal when losing the [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition in this way.

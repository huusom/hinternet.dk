# Dazing Blow  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](../../Rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed).
- **Activity** Single Action

You pummel a held foe, hoping to stagger them. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against a creature you have [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed). The weapon damage from this [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) is bludgeoning damage. If the [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the creature must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC; this is an [incapacitation](../../Rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Failure** The creature is [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

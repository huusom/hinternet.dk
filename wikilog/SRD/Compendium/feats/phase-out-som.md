# Phase Out  [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 6*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [evolution](../../Rules/traits/evolution-som.md)  [summoner](../../Rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: your eidolon is a phantom
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your eidolon phases out of reality slightly, gaining resistance to all damage (except force and negative) equal to half your level. It's not incorporeal, but it can't use [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) or actions that require a fully physical form, such as [Grapple](../../Rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md). Your eidolon can return to its normal form with a single action, which has the [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md) trait.

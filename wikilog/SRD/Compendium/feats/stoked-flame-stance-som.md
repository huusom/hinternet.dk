# Stoked Flame Stance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [fire](../../Rules/traits/fire.md)  [monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance of fast, fiery movements. You can make flashing spark attacks that deal `1d8` slashing damage. They are in the brawling group and have the [forceful](../../Rules/traits/forceful.md), [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [sweep](../../Rules/traits/sweep.md), and [unarmed](../../Rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits. If you have access to the flashing sparks' critical specialization effect, you can take an alternate effect instead: if your critical [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) dealt damage, the target takes `1d6` [persistent fire damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

While in Stoked Flame Stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed. If you have incredible movement, increase the benefit from incredible movement to a +15-foot status bonus plus 5 feet for every 4 levels beyond 3rd.

**Special.** This feat gains your choice of either the [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md) or [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md) trait, matching your ki spell tradition if possible.

## Stoked Flame Stance leads to...

[Blazing Streak](blazing-streak-som.md), [Inner Fire](inner-fire-som.md)

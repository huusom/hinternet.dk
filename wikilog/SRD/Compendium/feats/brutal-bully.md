# Brutal Bully  *Feat 6*  
[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You push your foes around and leave bruises. While raging, when you successfully [Disarm](../../Rules/actions/disarm.md), [Grapple](../../Rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md) a foe, you deal that foe bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier; add this to the damage from a critical success to [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md).

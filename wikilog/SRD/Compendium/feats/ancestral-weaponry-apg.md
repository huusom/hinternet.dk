# Ancestral Weaponry  *Feat 2*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Monastic Weaponry](monastic-weaponry.md), a feat granting access to all weapons with an ancestry trait (such as [elf](elven-weapon-familiarity.md) or orc)

You blend monastic techniques with the ancestral fighting styles of your people. Choose an ancestry for which you have access to all weapons with that trait. For you, melee weapons with that ancestry trait and either the [agile](../../Rules/traits/agile.md) or [finesse](../../Rules/traits/finesse.md) trait gain the [monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md) trait.

# Fiendsbane Oath  *Feat 2*  
[champion](../../Rules/traits/champion.md)  [oath](../../Rules/traits/oath.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You've sworn an oath to banish the corruption of fiends to the dark planes they call home. Add the following tenet to your champion's code after the other tenets: "You must banish or slay fiends you come across as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the incredibly unlikely event you find a good fiend, you don't have to banish or kill it."

Your [Retributive Strike](../../Rules/actions/retributive-strike.md) gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against a fiend, or a +6 circumstance bonus if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used. Your [Glimpse of Redemption](../../Rules/actions/glimpse-of-redemption.md)'s resistance against damage from a fiend is 7 + your level. If you use [Liberating Step](../../Rules/actions/liberating-step.md) triggered by a fiend, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your [Liberating Step](../../Rules/actions/liberating-step.md), and the ally can [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) twice afterward.

You don't consider fiends to be legitimate authorities, even in nations ruled by fiends.

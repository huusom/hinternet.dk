[grippli](../../Rules/traits/grippli-b2.md)

The [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) DC to [Force Open](../../Rules/actions/force-open.md) or [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) your nets increases from 16 to 18. After a creature you [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) with a net [Escapes](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) or Forces Open the net, stray strands of the net cling to the creature, causing them to remain [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the beginning of their next turn.

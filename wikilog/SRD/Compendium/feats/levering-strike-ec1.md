# Levering Strike  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [press](../../Rules/traits/press.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Staff Acrobat Dedication](staff-acrobat-dedication-ec1.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding your staff.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with your staff. As long as you don't critically fail, the target becomes [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) and takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its DC against [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md), [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md), and [Tumble Through](../../Rules/actions/tumble-through.md) attempts until the start of your next turn.

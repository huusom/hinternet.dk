# Hair Trigger  *Feat 16*  
[gunslinger](../../Rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: initial deed that allows you to [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a weapon

No one can react faster than you can pull your trigger. When using your initial deed, instead of Interacting to draw a weapon, you can [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with a firearm or crossbow you're already wielding. If this [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) hits, the target is also [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the end of your first turn of the encounter.

**Special.** If your initial deed allows you to [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) to draw a weapon more than once, this feat allows you to replace one of these [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) actions and use the other one to draw a weapon. You can't replace both [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) actions with [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), but you can draw a loaded firearm or crossbow with one of the actions and immediately shoot it with the other.

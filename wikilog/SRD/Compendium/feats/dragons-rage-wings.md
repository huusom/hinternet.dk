- **Prerequisites**: dragon instinct
- **Activity** Single Action

You sprout dragon wings from your back of the same color as your chosen dragon. While you are raging, you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed. If you are flying when your rage ends, you start to fall but the transformation only completes at the last moment, so you take no damage from the fall and land standing up.

## Dragon's Rage Wings leads to...

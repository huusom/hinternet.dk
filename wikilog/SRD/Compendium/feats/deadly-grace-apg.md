# Deadly Grace  *Feat 16*  
[swashbuckler](../../Rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  


Your graceful attacks are especially powerful. When you score a critical hit with an [agile](../../Rules/traits/agile.md) or [finesse](../../Rules/traits/finesse.md) melee weapon that has the [deadly](../../Rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, you double the number of dice from that trait. When you wield an [agile](../../Rules/traits/agile.md) or [finesse](../../Rules/traits/finesse.md) melee weapon that doesn't have the [deadly](../../Rules/traits/deadly.md) trait, it gains the [deadly d8](../../Rules/traits/deadly.md) trait instead.

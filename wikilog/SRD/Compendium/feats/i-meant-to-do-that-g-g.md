# I Meant To Do That  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), [Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication](unexpected-sharpshooter-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Requirements**: Your previous action was a ranged weapon [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) that missed a foe within 60 feet.
- **Activity** Single Action

Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet knocks your foe's weapon away or they stumble over stray debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check to attempt to [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md), [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md), or [Disarm](../../Rules/actions/disarm.md) the foe you missed.

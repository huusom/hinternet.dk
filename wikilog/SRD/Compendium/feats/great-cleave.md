# Great Cleave  *Feat 10*  
[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cleave](cleave.md)

Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. When you Cleave, if your [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) also kills or knocks the target [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), you can continue to make melee [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) until you make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) that doesn't kill or knock a creature [unconscious](../../Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked while Cleaving, whichever comes first.

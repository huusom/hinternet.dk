[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter the stance of impenetrable iron, refusing to yield to any blow. You can make iron sweep unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [parry](../../Rules/traits/parry.md), [sweep](../../Rules/traits/sweep.md), and [unarmed](../../Rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Ironblood Stance, you gain resistance 2 to all damage. The resistance increases to 3 at 12th level, to 4 at 16th level, and to 5 at 20th level.

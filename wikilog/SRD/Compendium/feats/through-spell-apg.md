# Through Spell  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[cleric](../../Rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Spells you cast can transform briefly into vital essence, traveling harmlessly through living and undead creatures between you and your target, blocked only by solid objects. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that requires a spell attack roll, your targets don't benefit from cover provided by living or undead creatures.

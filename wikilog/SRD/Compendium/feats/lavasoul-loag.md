# Lavasoul  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](../../Rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  [lineage](../../Rules/traits/lineage-apg.md)  


Your elemental lineage manifests as magma and molten rock, and you can focus the magma into your hand to attack your foes. You gain a magma spike unarmed attack, which requires a free hand to use. This is an [agile](../../Rules/traits/agile.md), [finesse](../../Rules/traits/finesse.md), [unarmed](../../Rules/traits/unarmed.md) attack in the brawling weapon group that deals `1d4` piercing damage, as well as 1 additional fire damage. Instead of the normal critical specialization effect, the target takes `1d6` [persistent fire damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); you gain a bonus on this [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to your item bonus to attack rolls on unarmed attacks.

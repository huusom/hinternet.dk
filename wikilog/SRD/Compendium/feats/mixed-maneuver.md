# Mixed Maneuver  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You combine two different maneuvers together into a single flowing whole. Choose any two of [Grapple](../../Rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md), and [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md). Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after resolving both attacks.

# Fortified Mind  *Feat 9*  
[kashrishi](../../Rules/traits/kashrishi-loil.md)  


Your mind is unusually resilient and resistant to influence. When you would gain the [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) or [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition, you can attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, you don't gain the [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) or [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) condition.

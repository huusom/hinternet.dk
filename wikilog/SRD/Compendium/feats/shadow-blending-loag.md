[fetchling](../../Rules/traits/fetchling-b2.md)  [illusion](../../Rules/traits/illusion.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  [shadow](../../Rules/traits/shadow.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature attempts a flat check to target you while you're [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) due to dim light or darkness.
- **Activity** Reaction

You draw shadows close to create a shroud. Increase the DC of the flat check by 2.

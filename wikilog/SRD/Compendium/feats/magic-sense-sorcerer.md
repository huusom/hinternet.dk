# Magic Sense (Sorcerer)  *Feat 12*  
[detection](../../Rules/traits/detection.md)  [divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [sorcerer](../../Rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  


You have a literal sixth sense for magic. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md) spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you [Seek](../../Rules/actions/seek.md), you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md) spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of [Seeking](../../Rules/actions/seek.md)). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.

**Special.** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast ([arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md), natural, or [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)).

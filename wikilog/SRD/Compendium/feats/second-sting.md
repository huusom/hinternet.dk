# Second Sting  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[press](../../Rules/traits/press.md)  [ranger](../../Rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You read your prey's movements and transform them into openings, so failures with one weapon set up glancing blows with the other. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with one of the required weapons against your hunted prey. The [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** You deal the damage the other required weapon would have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, not just weapon damage dice.)

# Spring Attack  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](../../Rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to an enemy.
- **Activity** Single Action

Springing away from one foe, you [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) at another. [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, but you must end that movement within melee reach of a different enemy. At the end of your movement, make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against an enemy now within reach. You can use Spring Attack while [Burrowing](../../Rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../Rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../Rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

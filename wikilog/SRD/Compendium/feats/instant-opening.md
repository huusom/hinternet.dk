# Instant Opening  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [rogue](../../Rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You distract your opponent with a few choice words or a rude gesture. Choose a target within 30 feet. It's [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your attacks until the end of your next turn. Depending on the way you describe your distraction, this action gains either the [auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md) trait.

# Enervating Wail  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [deviant](../../Rules/traits/deviant-da.md)  [magical](../../Rules/traits/magical.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [rare](../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You release a terrible wail that tears at the spirits of all nearby.

All living creatures in a 20-foot emanation take negative damage with a basic Fortitude save. The damage is `4d6`, plus `1d6` for every level you have beyond 6th.

**Awakening** Your scream echoes in the mind. You can choose to emit a silent psychic wail instead, which changes the damage type to mental, changes the save to a Will save, removes the [auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md) trait, and adds the [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) trait.

**Awakening** Your wail saps your foes' strength. In addition to the normal effects, living creatures in the area are [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round on a success (but not a critical success), [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute on a failure, and [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute on a critical failure.

# Jellyfish Stance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You relax your posture and loosen your joints, allowing yourself to move with incredible fluidity. You can make stinging lash attacks that deal `1d8` slashing damage. These attacks are in the brawling, and have the finesse, nonlethal, [reach](../../Rules/traits/reach.md), and [unarmed](../../Rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits.

While in Jellyfish Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves and on checks to [Escape](../../Rules/actions/escape.md) and [Squeeze](../../Rules/actions/squeeze.md).

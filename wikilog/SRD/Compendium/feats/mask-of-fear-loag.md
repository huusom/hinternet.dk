# Mask Of Fear  [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 13*  
[orc](../../Rules/traits/orc.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Orc Warmask](orc-warmask-loag.md)
- **Trigger** You start your turn with the [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition.
- **Requirements**: You're wearing your warmask.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your warmask burns off of your face, releasing your apprehension. You remove the [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition. Your warmask is destroyed, and you can't reapply it until your next daily preparations.

**Special.** You can use this free action even if you have a condition tied to the [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition that would normally prevent you from using a reaction, such as "[fleeing](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) as long as you're [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened)" or "[paralyzed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) as long as you're [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened)."

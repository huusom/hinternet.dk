# Tandem Strike  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[summoner](../../Rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  [tandem](../../Rules/traits/tandem-som.md)  

- **Requirements**: A creature is in your and your eidolon's reach.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You and your eidolon each attack, seamlessly targeting the same foe without interfering with each other's movements.

Your eidolon makes a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), and then you make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against the same creature. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks have been made.

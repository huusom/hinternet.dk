# Combat Grab  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](../../Rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You swipe at your opponent and grab at them. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) while keeping one hand free. If the [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you grab the target using your free hand. The creature remains [grabbed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Grabbed) until the end of your next turn or until it [Escapes](../../Rules/actions/escape.md), whichever comes first.

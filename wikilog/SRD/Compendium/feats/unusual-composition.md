# Unusual Composition  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[bard](../../Rules/traits/bard.md)  [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Polymath muse
- **Activity** Single Action

You can translate the emotion and power of a composition to other mediums. If your next action is to cast a composition spell, you can use a different kind of performance than usual for the composition to change any of its somatic components to verbal components or vice versa. As usual for composition spells, this changes whether the composition is [auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md) or [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md).

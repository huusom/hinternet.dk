# Dread Striker  *Feat 4*  
[rogue](../../Rules/traits/rogue.md)  


You capitalize on your enemies' fear to slip past their defenses. Any creature that has the [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition is also [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your attacks.

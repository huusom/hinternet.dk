# Six Pillars Stance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sixth Pillar Dedication](sixth-pillar-dedication-frp2.md)
- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You stand firm, steeling your mind and body, allowing you to use your magic unperturbed. While in this stance, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against reactions triggered by using actions with the [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md) or [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md) traits. In addition, when you cast a spell that requires one or more actions while in this stance, your unarmed [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage.

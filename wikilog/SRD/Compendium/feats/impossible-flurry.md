# Impossible Flurry  [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  [open](../../Rules/traits/open.md)  [ranger](../../Rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You forgo precision to attack at an impossible speed. Make three melee [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with each of the required weapons. All of these [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) take the maximum multiple attack penalty, as if you had already made two or more attacks this turn.

## Impossible Flurry leads to...

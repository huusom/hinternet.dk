# Ostentatious Arrival  [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [summoner](../../Rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  

- **Activity** Free Action

If the next action you take is to [Manifest your Eidolon](../../Rules/actions/manifest-eidolon-som.md) as a three-action activity, or to Cast a three-action summoning Spell, the creature appears in an explosion.

All creatures in a 10-foot emanation around the creature you summoned or manifested take `1d4` fire damage per spell level for a summoning spell, or `1d4` damage per 2 levels for Manifesting your Eidolon. If the creature you summoned or manifested has the acid, cold, electricity, fire, [sonic](../../Rules/traits/sonic.md), or [water](../../Rules/traits/water.md) trait, the damage is that type instead (or cold damage for the [water](../../Rules/traits/water.md) trait). If the creature has more than one of these traits, you choose which damage type to deal.

# Practiced Opposition  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You've battled more undead than you care to remember, often with little time to prepare between foes, forcing you to rely on experience and muscle memory to guide your blade. Attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) about an undead you can see and then [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) that undead. If your attempt to [Recall Knowledge](../../Rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) is successful, your [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) treats the target's resistances as 5 lower. The target is then immune to your Practiced Opposition for 24 hours.

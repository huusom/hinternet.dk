# Distracting Spellstrike  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[magus](../../Rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: laughing shadow hybrid study, [Spellstrike](../../Rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md)
- **Requirements**: You're in [Arcane Cascade](../../Rules/actions/arcane-cascade-som.md) stance and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You weave distracting magic with one hand to enhance your [Spellstrike](../../Rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md). Make a [Spellstrike](../../Rules/actions/spellstrike-som.md) and [Feint](../../Rules/actions/feint.md) against the target of your [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). Do this immediately before making the [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), but after choosing your target. The [Feint](../../Rules/actions/feint.md) gains the [arcane](../../Rules/traits/arcane.md), [illusion](../../Rules/traits/illusion.md), and [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md) traits, and it always has the basic effects of a [Feint](../../Rules/actions/feint.md), rather than applying any adjustments or alternate effects from other feats or abilities.

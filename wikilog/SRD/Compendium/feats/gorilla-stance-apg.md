# Gorilla Stance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You lower yourself to the ground and take an imposing, knuckle-walking stance. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks.

These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [backswing](../../Rules/traits/backswing.md), [forceful](../../Rules/traits/forceful.md), [grapple](../../Rules/traits/grapple.md), [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](../../Rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits. While you are in Gorilla Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Climb](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), and if you roll a success on an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Climb](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), you get a critical success instead.

## Gorilla Stance leads to...

[Gorilla Pound](gorilla-pound-apg.md)

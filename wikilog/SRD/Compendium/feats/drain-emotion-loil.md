# Drain Emotion  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 9*  
[enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [rare](../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fey Influence](fey-influence-loil.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You touch an adjacent creature and attempt to draw out its excess emotion. Attempt a counteract check against a single [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) or [fear](../../Rules/traits/fear.md) effect affecting the touched creature. If you succeed, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).

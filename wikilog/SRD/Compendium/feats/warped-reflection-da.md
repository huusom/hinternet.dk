# Warped Reflection  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../Rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [reflection](../../Rules/traits/reflection-da.md)  [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

Due to your origins, your form is more flexible than most. You shift your appearance to resemble a creature within 30 feet but with an unsettling, horrifying twist. Though this transformation is momentary, witnessing it gives the target deep existential dread. It must succeed at a Will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or become [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) ([frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical failure) and be [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) as long as the [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition lasts. Once you've used Warped Reflection against a creature, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.

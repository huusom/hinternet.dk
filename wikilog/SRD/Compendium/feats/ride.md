# Ride  *Feat 1*  
[general](../../Rules/traits/general.md)  


When you [Command an Animal](../../Rules/actions/command-an-animal.md) you're mounted on to take a [move](../../Rules/traits/move.md) action (such as [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md)), you automatically succeed instead of needing to attempt a check. Any animal you're mounted on acts on your turn, like a minion. If you [Mount](../../Rules/actions/mount.md) an animal in the middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on your next turn. Page 249 has more on [Command an Animal](../../Rules/actions/command-an-animal.md).

# Space-Time Shift  [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You travel just a few moments into the future to immediately arrive at your destination. Your [Strides](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with your [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) instead of traversing normally to the location. Your augmented [Strides](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) have the teleport trait and don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square. You also augment your [Burrow](../../Rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](../../Rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](../../Rules/actions/swim.md) actions in this way if you have the corresponding movement type.

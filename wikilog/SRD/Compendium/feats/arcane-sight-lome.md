# Arcane Sight  *Feat 13*  
[goloma](../../Rules/traits/goloma-lome.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to cast the [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md) cantrip

You've trained yourself to constantly be on the lookout for [magical](../../Rules/traits/magical.md) effects, even when focusing on looking out for other things. When you are [Searching](../../Rules/actions/search.md), you also gain the benefits of Detect Magic unless you choose not to. See page 479 of the Core Rulebook for more information about exploration activities.

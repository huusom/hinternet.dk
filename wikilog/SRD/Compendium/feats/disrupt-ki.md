# Disrupt Ki  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Make an unarmed [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). If it deals damage to a living creature, you block that creature's inner life force. The creature takes `2d6` [persistent negative damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the [persistent damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends. If you're 18th level or higher, this deals `3d6` [persistent negative damage](../../Rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) instead.

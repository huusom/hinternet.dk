# Foreseen Failure  [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 12*  
[divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  [psychic](../../Rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A spell you cast has no effect because you critically failed all your spell attack rolls or because all targets critically succeeded at their saving throws.
- **Activity** Free Action

You see your spell fail to take hold to disastrous end, then snap back to realityâ€”it was all a precognition, and you know to try a different spell. Your spell is expended, but you can [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that requires the same number of actions as the triggering spell or fewer to cast. The second spell must be a different spell than the first.

# Wolf Drag  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wolf Stance](wolf-stance.md)
- **Requirements**: You are in Wolf Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You rip your enemy off their feet. Make a wolf jaw [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). Your wolf jaw gains the [fatal <d12>](../../Rules/traits/fatal.md) trait for this [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), and if the attack succeeds, you knock the target [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone).

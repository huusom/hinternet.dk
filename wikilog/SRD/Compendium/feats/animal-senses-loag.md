# Animal Senses  *Feat 1*  
[beastkin](../../Rules/traits/beastkin-loag.md)  


You gain one of the following senses available to your inherent animal: [darkvision](../../Rules/abilities/darkvision.md), [low-light vision](../../Rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md), or [scent](../../Rules/abilities/scent.md) (imprecise) 30 feet. You must have [low-light vision](../../Rules/abilities/low-light-vision.md) before you can gain [darkvision](../../Rules/abilities/darkvision.md) with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a specific type of sense, you can't gain that sense with this feat.

**Special.** You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different sense each time.

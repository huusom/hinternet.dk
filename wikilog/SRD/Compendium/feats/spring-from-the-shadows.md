# Spring From The Shadows  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  [rogue](../../Rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Leaping out from hiding, you assail your target when they least expect it. You [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, but you must end your movement next to an enemy you're [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by. You then [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) that enemy; you remain [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from or [undetected](../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by that creature until after you [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). You can use Spring from the Shadows while [Burrowing](../../Rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../Rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../Rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

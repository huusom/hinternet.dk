# Sudden Charge (Fighter)  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](../../Rules/traits/flourish.md)  [open](../../Rules/traits/open.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while [Burrowing](../../Rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../Rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../Rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

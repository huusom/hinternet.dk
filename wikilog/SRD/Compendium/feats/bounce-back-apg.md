# Bounce Back  [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 13*  
[human](../../Rules/traits/human.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You lose the [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition.
- **Activity** Free Action

You recover from near-death experiences with astounding resilience. Don't increase the value of your [wounded](../../Rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition due to losing the [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition.

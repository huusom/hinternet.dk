# Ringmaster's Introduction  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [bard](../../Rules/traits/bard.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Trigger** An ally's turn begins.
- **Requirements**: The ally hasn't acted in the current combat.
- **Activity** Reaction

You announce the triggering ally with a litany of their legendary achievements, spurring them to action. The target is [quickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Quickened) this turn and can spend the extra action to [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md), [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md), [Demoralize](../../Rules/actions/demoralize.md), [Feint](../../Rules/actions/feint.md), or [Perform](../../Rules/actions/perform.md).

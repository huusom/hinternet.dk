# Twin Shot Knockdown  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[gunslinger](../../Rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded crossbow or loaded firearm in each hand.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You fire at an enemy while targeting a part of its anatomy that will disrupt its balance. Make two [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against the same target, one with each of the required weapons. If both [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) are successful, the target is also knocked [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone).

# Surprise Snare  [>>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Snarecrafter Dedication](snarecrafter-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Three-Action

You install one of your snares prepared for quick deployment in a space that's occupied by an opponent. It must be a snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to [Craft](../../Rules/actions/craft.md). The snare automatically triggers, but it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to any applicable save DC, as well as any attack rolls or other checks the snare attempts.

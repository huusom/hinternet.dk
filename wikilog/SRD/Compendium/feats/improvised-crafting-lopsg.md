[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [exploration](../../Rules/traits/exploration.md)  [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [skill](../../Rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](swordmaster-dedication-locg.md), expert in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You can attempt to [Repair](../../Rules/actions/repair.md) an item without a repair kit, instead improvising tools out of your gear or found items. This adds 5 minutes to the time it takes to [Repair](../../Rules/actions/repair.md) the item. You can also [Repair](../../Rules/actions/repair.md) an item while on the move without needing a stable surface. This adds 10 minutes to the times it takes to [Repair](../../Rules/actions/repair.md) the item.

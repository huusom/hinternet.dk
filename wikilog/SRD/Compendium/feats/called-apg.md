# Called  *Feat 5*  
[changeling](../../Rules/traits/changeling-b1.md)  


You have heard the Call, and in constantly resisting that persistent demand, you've developed a mental bulwark against effects that would target your mind. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saving throws against [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) effects. If you roll a success on your saving throw against a [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md) effect that would make you [controlled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Controlled), you get a critical success instead.

# Sense Allies  *Feat 5*  
[human](../../Rules/traits/human.md)  


Like many humans raised in a close-knit community, you have always been strongly attuned to the presence of others. Willing allies that you are aware of within 60 feet that would otherwise be [undetected](../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected) by you are instead [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you. The flat check for you to target willing allies within 60 feet that are [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you is 5 instead of 11.

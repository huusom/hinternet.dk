[general](../../Rules/traits/general.md)  [skill](../../Rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)

You can [Crawl](../../Rules/actions/crawl.md) incredibly swiftlyâ€”up to half your Speed, rather than 5 feet. If you're a master in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), you can [Crawl](../../Rules/actions/crawl.md) at full Speed, and if you're legendary, you aren't [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) while [prone](../../Rules/conditions.md#Prone).

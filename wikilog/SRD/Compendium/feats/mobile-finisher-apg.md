You attack in motion. [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) and then [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). You can use Mobile Finisher while [Burrowing](../../Rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climbing](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), [Flying](../../Rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](../../Rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Striding](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

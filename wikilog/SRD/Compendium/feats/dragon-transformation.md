# Dragon Transformation  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [instinct](../../Rules/traits/instinct.md)  [polymorph](../../Rules/traits/polymorph.md)  [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)  [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md)  [transmutation](../../Rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: dragon instinct, [Dragon's Rage Wings](dragons-rage-wings.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You transform into a ferocious Large dragon, gaining the effects of 6th-level [dragon form](../spells/dragon-form.md) except that you use your own AC and attack modifier; you also apply your extra damage from [Rage](../../Rules/actions/rage.md), and the Breath Weapon uses your class DC. The action to [Dismiss](../../Rules/actions/dismiss.md) the transformation gains the [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md) trait.

At 18th level, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your fly Speed, your damage bonus with dragon [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) increases to +12, and you gain a +14 status bonus to your breath weapon damage.

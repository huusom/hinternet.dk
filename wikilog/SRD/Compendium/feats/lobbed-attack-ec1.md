# Lobbed Attack  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance), [Juggler Dedication](juggler-dedication-ec1.md)
- **Requirements**: You are Juggling a thrown weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You make a thrown ranged [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon, using the weapon's normal range increment. This attack doesn't trigger reactions, and if the target has never seen you use this feat before, the target is [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against this attack.

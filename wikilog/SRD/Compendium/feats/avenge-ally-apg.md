# Avenge Ally  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[elf](../../Rules/traits/elf.md)  [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md)  

- **Frequency**: once every 10 minutes
- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to an ally with the [dying](../../Rules/conditions.md#Dying) condition.
- **Activity** Single Action

Though you know that you will eventually outlive your companions, seeing them at death's door brings clarity to your attacks. Make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). Roll twice on the attack roll and use the higher result.

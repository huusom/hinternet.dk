[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Trigger** A foe within reach attempts to move away from you.
- **Activity** Reaction

You keep pace with a retreating foe. [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use No Escape to [Burrow](../../Rules/actions/burrow.md), [Climb](../../Rules/actions/climb.md), [Fly](../../Rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](../../Rules/actions/swim.md) instead of [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.

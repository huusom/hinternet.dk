# Cryptic Spell  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [druid](../../Rules/traits/druid.md)  [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're in natural terrain.
- **Activity** Single Action

You hide your magic in the croak of a frog, in the sway of the trees, in the howl of the wind, and the flicker of the will-o'-wisp.

If the next action you take is to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), attempt a [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) check against all observers' [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DCs. If you succeed at your check against an observer's [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DC, that observer doesn't notice that you're [Casting a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), even though verbal, somatic, and material components are usually noticeable, and spells normally have sensory manifestations that would make spellcasting obvious to those nearby. All of these are instead [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in the natural sights and sounds of the environment.

This ability hides only the spell's spellcasting actions and manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see you transform into a giant bear.

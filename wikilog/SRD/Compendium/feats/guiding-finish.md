# Guiding Finish  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](../../Rules/traits/press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding only a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
- **Activity** Single Action

Using your weapon as a lever, you force your opponent to end up right where you want them. Make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with the required weapon. If the [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) hits, you can move the target up to 10 feet into a space in your reach. You can move the target through your space during this movement. This follows the forced movement rules found on page 475. Your [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** You can force the creature to move as you would on a success, but you can move the target only 5 feet.

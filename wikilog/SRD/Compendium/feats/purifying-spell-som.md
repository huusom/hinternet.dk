# Purifying Spell  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [druid](../../Rules/traits/druid.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [water](../../Rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: wave order
- **Activity** Single Action

You purify the water within a creature's body to cleanse them of illness. If the next action you use is to cast [heal](../spells/heal.md) targeting a single living creature, you can attempt to counteract a disease or poison affecting the target, in addition to the other benefits of heal. If you do, heal gains the [water](../../Rules/traits/water.md) trait.

# Reflective Ripple Stance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  [water](../../Rules/traits/water.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance of fluid grace as small amounts of water flow with your movements and attacks. You can make flowing wave attacks that deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage.

They are in the brawling group and have the [agile](../../Rules/traits/agile.md), [disarm](../../Rules/traits/disarm.md), [finesse](../../Rules/traits/finesse.md), [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md), [trip](../../Rules/traits/trip.md), [unarmed](../../Rules/traits/unarmed.md), and [water](../../Rules/traits/water.md) traits.

While in Reflective Ripple Stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Disarm](../../Rules/actions/disarm.md), [Swim](../../Rules/actions/swim.md), or [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC to avoid being Disarmed and Tripped.

**Special.** This feat gains your choice of either the [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md) or [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md) trait, matching your ki spell tradition if possible.

## Reflective Ripple Stance leads to...

[Rippling Spin](rippling-spin-som.md), [Wave Spiral](wave-spiral-som.md)

# Twin Feint  [>>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[rogue](../../Rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a dazzling series of attacks with both weapons, using the first attack to throw your foe off guard against a second attack at a different angle. Make one [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with each of your two melee weapons, both against the same target. The target is automatically [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the second attack. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) normally.

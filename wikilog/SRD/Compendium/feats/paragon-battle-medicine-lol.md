# Paragon Battle Medicine  *Feat 7*  
[general](../../Rules/traits/general.md)  [rare](../../Rules/traits/rare.md)  [skill](../../Rules/traits/skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Battle Medicine](battle-medicine.md), master in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

Kassi Aziril taught you her techniques that originated the modern use of [Battle Medicine](battle-medicine.md).

When you successfully use [Battle Medicine](battle-medicine.md), you can also reduce the target's [sickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Sickened), [enfeebled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled), or [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) condition by 1 (this has no effect if you are subject to an effect continually applying the [clumsy](../../Rules/conditions.md#Clumsy) condition, like enlarge). If you are legendary in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine), you can choose to reduce the target's [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) or [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition by 1 instead, and if you have the Godless Healing feat, you can choose to reduce the target's [stupefied](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) or [drained](../../Rules/conditions.md#Drained) condition by 1 instead. If you have the Mortal Healing feat, you can reduce all available conditions by 1 for a target who hasn't benefited from positive or healing magic in the last 24 hours, and if you roll a critical success before applying the effects of the feat, you reduce all available conditions by 2 for that target instead.

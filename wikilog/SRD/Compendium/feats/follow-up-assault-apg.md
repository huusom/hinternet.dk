# Follow-up Assault  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Requirements**: You used your previous action to make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) that missed.
- **Activity** Single Action

Even in the face of failure you press the attack, determined to succeed. Make a [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with the same weapon, adding the effects of the [backswing](../../Rules/traits/backswing.md) and [forceful](../../Rules/traits/forceful.md) weapon traits.

# Know Oneself  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md)  [human](../../Rules/traits/human.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Vudrani ethnicity
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

You center yourself and call to mind the Vudrani monastic ideals of mindfulness and self-knowledge. You fail the save against the [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md) effect instead of critically failing.

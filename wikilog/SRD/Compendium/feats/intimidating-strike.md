[emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [fear](../../Rules/traits/fear.md)  [fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Your blow not only wounds creatures but also shatters their confidence. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit and deal damage, the target is [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit.

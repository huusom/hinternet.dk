# Shadow Self  *Feat 17*  
[halfling](../../Rules/traits/halfling.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You successfully use [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) to [Hide](../../Rules/actions/hide.md) and become [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from all your current foes, or use [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) to [Sneak](../../Rules/actions/sneak.md) and become [undetected](../../Rules/conditions.md#Undetected) to all your current foes.

With a powerful talent for misdirection, you slip from your adversaries' notice so thoroughly you appear to be somewhere else. You become [invisible](../../Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for 1 minute or until you take a [hostile](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, whichever comes first. Choose a location within 10 feet of you. Until your invisibility ends, you appear to be [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) in that location to anyone trying to find you. If the searcher gets clear evidence that you're not there, they no longer think you're [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) there, but they don't discover your actual location.

# Distracting Shadows  *Feat 1*  
[halfling](../../Rules/traits/halfling.md)  


You have learned to remain [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) by using larger folk as a distraction to avoid drawing attention to yourself. You can use creatures that are at least one size larger than you (usually Medium or larger) as cover for the [Hide](../../Rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](../../Rules/actions/sneak.md) actions, though you still can't use such creatures as cover for other uses, such as the [Take Cover](../../Rules/actions/take-cover.md) action.

## Distracting Shadows leads to...

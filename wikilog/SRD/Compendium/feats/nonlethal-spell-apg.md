# Nonlethal Spell  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [wizard](../../Rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You can alter offensive spells to be less deadly. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) that deals damage and doesn't have the [death](../../Rules/traits/death.md) or [negative](../../Rules/traits/negative.md) trait, that spell gains the [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md) trait.

# Enduring Quickness  *Feat 20*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  


You move as fast and as high as the wind itself. You're permanently [quickened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Quickened). You can use your extra action to [Stride](../../Rules/actions/stride.md) or [Leap](../../Rules/actions/leap.md), or to provide one of the actions needed for a [High Jump](../../Rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](../../Rules/actions/long-jump.md).

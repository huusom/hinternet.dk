# Eat Fortune  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [divination](../../Rules/traits/divination.md)  [divine](../../Rules/traits/divine.md)  [tengu](../../Rules/traits/tengu-b1.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A creature within 60 feet uses a [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md) or [misfortune](../../Rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

As someone tries to twist fate, you consume the interference.

The triggering effect is disrupted. If it's a [misfortune](../../Rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect, Eat Fortune gains the [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md) trait; if it's a [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md) effect, Eat Fortune gains the [misfortune](../../Rules/traits/misfortune.md) trait. This fortune or misfortune applies to the same roll the triggering effect would have, so you couldn't negate a [fortune](../../Rules/traits/fortune.md) effect with Eat Fortune and then apply a [misfortune](../../Rules/traits/misfortune.md) effect to the same roll.

## Eat Fortune leads to...

[Jinx Glutton](jinx-glutton-loag.md)

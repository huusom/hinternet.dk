[amp](../../Rules/traits/amp-da.md)  [emotion](../../Rules/traits/emotion.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [psychic](../../Rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  


Your spells release soothing mental waves. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. You can use this amp only on a psi cantrip that targets or affects you or one or more of your allies and doesn't target or affect any enemies.

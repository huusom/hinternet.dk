# Touch Focus  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [manipulate](../../Rules/traits/manipulate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sixth Pillar Dedication](sixth-pillar-dedication-frp2.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You can redirect a spell's power through you to deliver it within striking distance. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) with 1 or more targets and a range farther than touch, you can change the range to touch. If the altered spell requires a spell attack roll, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack. This only allows you to touch a single target with the spell, even if the spell originally affected more than 1 target. After you [Cast the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md), you can [Disarm](../../Rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](../../Rules/actions/shove.md), [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md), or [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) the target with an unarmed attack.

# Supernatural Senses  *Feat 4*  
[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acute Scent](acute-scent.md) or precise or imprecise [scent](../../Rules/abilities/scent.md)

Your [scent](../../Rules/abilities/scent.md) is preternaturally sharp, and you can always rely on your sense of smell to help guide you when your vision is compromised. When you target a [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) opponent while you are [raging](../../Rules/actions/rage.md), you reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a [concealed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Concealed) target or to 9 for a [hidden](../../Rules/conditions.md#Hidden) one.

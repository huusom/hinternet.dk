# Stumbling Stance  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[monk](../../Rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](../../Rules/traits/stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriatedâ€”bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Feint](../../Rules/actions/feint.md). The only [Strikes](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal `1d8` bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](../../Rules/traits/agile.md), [backstabber](../../Rules/traits/backstabber.md), [finesse](../../Rules/traits/finesse.md), [nonlethal](../../Rules/traits/nonlethal.md), and [unarmed](../../Rules/traits/unarmed.md) traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) while in this stance, it becomes [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next stumbling swing [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) you make against it before the end of your next turn.

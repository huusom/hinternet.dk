[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [evocation](../../Rules/traits/evocation.md)  [mindshift](../../Rules/traits/mindshift-da.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  [psyche](../../Rules/traits/psyche-da.md)  [psychic](../../Rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Activity** Single Action

With a passing thought, you direct violent psychic energies at a nearby creature. Target one creature within 30 feet. It takes `1d4` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by `1d4`.

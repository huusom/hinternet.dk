# Echoing Spell  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 18*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](../../Rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You time the components of your spell with exacting precision, setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell's effects. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 4th level or lower that has no duration, the spell's energy reverberates and echoes. You can [Cast the Spell](../../Rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) a second time before the end of your next turn without expending a spell slot.

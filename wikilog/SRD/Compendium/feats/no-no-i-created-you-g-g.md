[auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [inventor](../../Rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: construct companion
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** Your construct companion would become [confused](../../Rules/conditions.md#Confused) or [controlled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Controlled).
- **Activity** Reaction

You appeal to your construct companion's bond with its creator to have it break free of a controlling effect. Attempt to counteract the effect that [confused](../../Rules/conditions.md#Confused) or [controlled](../../Rules/conditions.md#Controlled) your construct companion, using your [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) modifier for the counteract check and half your level rounded up for the counteract level.

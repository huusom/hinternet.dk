# Forestall Curse  [>](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[concentrate](../../Rules/traits/concentrate.md)  [metamagic](../../Rules/traits/metamagic.md)  [oracle](../../Rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You've learned to forestall the effects of your curse somewhat. If the next action you use is to cast a [revelation](../../Rules/traits/revelation.md) spell, the severity of your curse doesn't increase.

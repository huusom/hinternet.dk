# Skillful Tail ()  *Feat 5*  
[ifrit](../../Rules/traits/ifrit-b2.md)  [oread](../../Rules/traits/oread-b2.md)  [suli](../../Rules/traits/suli-b2.md)  [sylph](../../Rules/traits/sylph-b2.md)  [undine](../../Rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  


You were born with a tail, and with practice you've learned how to perform simple [Interact](../../Rules/actions/interact.md) actions with it, such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.

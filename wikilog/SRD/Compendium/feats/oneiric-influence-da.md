# Oneiric Influence  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [enchantment](../../Rules/traits/enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](../../Rules/traits/incapacitation.md)  [mental](../../Rules/traits/mental.md)  [occult](../../Rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Infiltrate Dream](infiltrate-dream-da.md)

While Infiltrating a Dream, you can also implant a suggestion in the target's mind. The target must attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, to resist your modification, which has the effects of a [subconscious suggestion](../spells/subconscious-suggestion.md) spell, but even on a critical success, the target doesn't realize you were trying to control them and may not recognize your presence in the dream. The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious for 1 week or until triggered. Their memories of carrying out the suggestion are hazy and dreamlike and they may not remember doing it unless later reminded.

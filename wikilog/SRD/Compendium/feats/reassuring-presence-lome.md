# Reassuring Presence  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[anadi](../../Rules/traits/anadi-lome.md)  [auditory](../../Rules/traits/auditory.md)  [visual](../../Rules/traits/visual.md)  

- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet gains the [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition.
- **Activity** Reaction

You serve as an anchor to your close companions, calming them in times of stress.

Decrease the value of the triggering ally's [frightened](../../Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1. The ally is then temporarily immune to your Reassuring Presence for 1 hour.

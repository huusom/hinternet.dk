# Astonishing Explosion  [F](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 20*  
[additive <2>](../../Rules/traits/additive.md)  [alchemist](../../Rules/traits/alchemist.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](../../Rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemical bomb that deals splash damage and is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your bomb incorporates an explosive spark of wonder that leaves witnesses dumbfounded. Any target hit by your [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) with the bomb is [fascinated](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fascinated) by you for 1 round. On a critical success, the target is also [stunned](../../Rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

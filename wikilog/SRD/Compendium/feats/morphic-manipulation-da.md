# Morphic Manipulation  *Feat 7*  
[exploration](../../Rules/traits/exploration.md)  [general](../../Rules/traits/general.md)  [necromancy](../../Rules/traits/necromancy.md)  [positive](../../Rules/traits/positive.md)  [primal](../../Rules/traits/primal.md)  [skill](../../Rules/traits/skill.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature)

You've attuned your natural aura to that of plant life, coaxing it to grow faster than normal. You sit for 10 minutes with a small, natural non-creature plant—such as a lone flower, a small bush, or a potted succulent—while you bring your aura in tune through meditation. You coax the plant to advance one stage in its life cycle: from seed to sprout, sprout to plant, plant to flower, or flower to fruit. If the plant doesn't have proper nutrients (if you're sprouting a seed without soil or water, for example), the plant withers 5 minutes after you complete the activity. Performing this activity more than once per day renders you [fatigued](../../Rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and unable to use Morphic Manipulation until your next full night's rest.

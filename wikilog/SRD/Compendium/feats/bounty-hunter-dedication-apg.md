# Bounty Hunter Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](../../Rules/traits/archetype.md)  [dedication](../../Rules/traits/dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the [Hunt Prey](../../Rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) action. You can use [Hunt Prey](../../Rules/actions/hunt-prey.md) to designate only a creature that you've seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of [Hunt Prey](../../Rules/actions/hunt-prey.md), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [Gather Information](../../Rules/actions/gather-information.md) regarding your prey.

If you already have [Hunt Prey](../../Rules/actions/hunt-prey.md), you become an expert in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) and gain the circumstance bonus to [Gather Information](../../Rules/actions/gather-information.md) about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype.

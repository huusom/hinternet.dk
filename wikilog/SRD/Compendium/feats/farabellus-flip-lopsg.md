[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [fighter](../../Rules/traits/fighter.md)  [ranger](../../Rules/traits/ranger.md)  [uncommon](../../Rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) and medium armor
- **Trigger** An enemy targets you with a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

If the attack still hits you, you can [Step](../../Rules/actions/step.md) to an open space that's still within the triggering enemy's reach, turning the impact of the blow into momentum.

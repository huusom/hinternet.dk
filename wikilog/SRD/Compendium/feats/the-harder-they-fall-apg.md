# The Harder They Fall  *Feat 4*  
[rogue](../../Rules/traits/rogue.md)  


You make your foes fall painfully when you trip them. When you successfully [Trip](../../Rules/actions/trip.md) a [flat-footed](../../Rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) foe, your target takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage. On a critical success, the target takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage plus your sneak attack damage.

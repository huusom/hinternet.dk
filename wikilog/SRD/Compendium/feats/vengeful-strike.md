# Vengeful Strike  [R](../../Rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[barbarian](../../Rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](../../Rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Come and Get Me](come-and-get-me.md)
- **Trigger** A creature within your reach succeeds or critically succeeds at an attack against you.
- **Requirements**: You're under the effect of Come and Get Me.
- **Activity** Reaction

When struck by an enemy, you respond in turn. Make a melee [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) against the triggering creature. This [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](../../Rules/actions/strike.md).

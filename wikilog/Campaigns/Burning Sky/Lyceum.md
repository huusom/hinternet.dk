At the end of a swampy isthmus on [Dassen](./Dassen.md)’s southern tip, the town of [[Seaquen]] is home to a school called Lyceum, devoted to teaching magic of all kinds. Students of Lyceum are encouraged to learn a variety of magical styles, and are trained in spelldueling techniques similar to [[Gabals Magiskole|Gabal’s school]] in [Gate Pass](./Gate%20Pass.md). They were relatively unknown in the region until recently, when [Simeon](./Simeon%20Gohannach.md), headmaster of the school, sent out a call to all the people in and around [Ragesia](./Ragesia.md), asking for them to stand up against the
threat posed by the Ragesians and their new leader [Leska](./Leska.md).

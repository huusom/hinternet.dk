==## Ragesia is the largest nation in the region, and four other nations commonly interact with it. The politics and history of the region are relatively simple, though the recent power vacuum in Ragesia threatens to make things much more complicated.
 
 Overview ==
The Ragesian Empire lies in the northwest of the region, spanning several hundred miles north to south and east to west. To the east is the Shining Land of [Shahalesti](Shahalesti.md), a tenuous ally with whom relations have frayed of late. To the south lie the
Exarchate of [Sindaire](Sindaire.md), the Kingdom of [Dassen](Dassen.md), and the Khaganhold of [Ostalin](Ostalin.md), three nations which so far have managed to avoid being conquered by Ragesia.’
'''Capital City''' – Ragos (Metropolis): Conventional; AL LE; Mixed (56% human, 24% orc, 16%
half-orc, 2% elf, 1% half-elf, 1% other).
The Ragesian Empire is based in the capital city of Ragos, located on central lowlands dominated by many lakes. While the core of the empire is populated heavily by orcs and half-orcs, the outer regions have wildly diverse cultures and populations, the result of having once been many separate nations, conquered by sword and torch. 
Every region has a large component of orcs in the population, along with heavy military presence to ensure loyalty and peace. Though the people of Ragesia have been conquered, most are content that they live today in relative safety. Given the power of the empire, rebellion just doesn’t seem worth it. The majority of the population is still human however, or
half-orc, and different ethnic groups remain mostly concentrated in their old homelands, which are often separated by low, long mountain ranges.
The northern reaches are home to people known as the [[Kelaquois]], who live in frigid lands that are frozen for most of the year, where they coexist with frost giants, mastadons, and vast herds of bison. The western plains were once the nation of [[Latia]], its renowned ship-building now benefiting Ragesia and its navy. The southern lands are craggy, with cold rocky deserts dominating what was once Chathus, a land of nomads and traders who nevertheless defended their lands with great vigour, using cavalry and mobility to wage a protracted war, allowing their home to be the last conquered by Ragesia. The
central heartlands once belonged to the powerful nation of Morrus, and numerous old castles, forts, and walls dot the landscape, defenses which were easily bypassed with Emperor Coaltongue’s Torch.
The capital city of Ragos stretches along a vast lake, and the imperial palace lies safely offshore on a fantastically defended island. At night its walls burn with thousands of torches, making the lake look like it is on fire.
An ocean borders Ragesia to the west, with rocky mountains marking Ragesia’s borders with the nations to the south — Sindaire and Dassen.
The northern border is a high, frigid mountain range, separating Ragesia from most of the rest of the world. The same mountains curve down to form the eastern border, rising high enough that Ragesia never saw much value in trying to conquer beyond them.

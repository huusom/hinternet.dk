Devoted to keeping the city of [Gate Pass](Gate%20Pass.md) free from the rule of both [Ragesia](Ragesia.md) and [Shahalesti](Shahalesti.md), the resistance is composed of a huge variety of people from many of countries, since many nations have a vested interest in keeping the current balance of power. Mostly they work to bolster pride among the citizens of Gate Pass, though occasionally a spy is turned over to the authorities by unknown persons, and the resistance is credited with the capture. 
Many farmers and ranchers who live in the mountains surrounding the city claim to have spoken to members of the resistance, who encouraged them to be prepared to fight to defend their lands.

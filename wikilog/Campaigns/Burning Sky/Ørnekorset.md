'''Knights of the Aquiline Cross'''

The Order of the Aquiline Cross originally emerged in Sindaire a decade ago. Since then, small chapels that teach the order’s doctrine of mercy, sacrifice, and a fierce defense of life have sprung up
throughout the lands of Ragesia and its neighbors. Knights of this order dress in white and red tabards marked with a cross surrounded by a halo of feathers.

Many knights take a vow to heal all they meet that may need it, and dedicate themselves to ease the suffering of others.

The Knights of the Aquiline Cross are clerics and paladins who see healing as the best way to fight evil. They cannot refuse using their healing powers to those who ask (though they’re not required to heal
enemies who have not surrendered). Followers of the order who maintain their vow of healing are said to miraculously survive injury, as if they simply do not bleed from even seemingly-fatal wounds.

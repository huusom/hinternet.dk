Gabal, a famed evoker who helped drive the
Ragesians out forty years ago, maintains a school
of war. This large cluster of squat towers connected
by covered bridges and surrounded by a moat and
fence is jokingly known as The Castle. Gabal’s students
— easily identifiable by their red robes — are
generally viewed as arrogant and hot-tempered, but
their mentor forces them to sell their services for
low prices, particularly in matters of defense and
construction, and a handful of wizards serve in the
city military.
Gabal is said to scorn magic-users who do not
study spellbooks for their powers, and has a particular
dislike for sorcerers, commonly saying he doesn’t
trust people who have that much charisma. Charm
is a personality flaw Gabal proudly lacks.

In this vision, a much younger Coaltongue and a small horde of orcs battle the gold dragon [Syana](Syana.md) at the edge of a waterfall. A young gold dragon, [Trilla](Trilla.md), is chained and
guarded, and one of the guards is Karedan, wearing a red tunic the same color as his current armor. A group of allies fighting with Syana are aided by an archon, while a bone
devil fights at Coaltongue’s side.
A shadowy figure wielding Rhuarc's black
scimitar appears and slices through Coaltongue's
axe haft. The blade falls to the ground,
and Coaltongue grimaces darkly, tossing aside
the useless handle.
As the trumpet archon cuts down the bone
devil, the disarmed Coaltongue plants a boot
on the young Rhuarc's chest and thrusts him
into the river, sending him tumbling over the
waterfall. Then he rips the femur from the
bone devil just in time to parry a killing blow
from the trumpet archon. He grabs the archon
by its neck and drives it to the ground, then
caves in its skull with the bone club.
The club begins to glimmer with fire as
Coaltongue stands and orders his orcs to all
fire at Syana, who is wheeling in the air for a
strafing pass. Hundreds of arrows rise into the
sky, blotting out the sun, but Syana breathes
a gout of fire that ignites them, filling the sky
with a rain of cinders. Unfazed, Coaltongue
strides over to the panicking young Trilla,
plants his heel on her neck, and holds the
newborn [[Torch]] high, threatening to kill the
child if her mother does not relent.
But Syana draws in a breath, and fire engulfs
the warlord as he brings down the Torch in
spite. The blow connects with Trilla’s jaw, a tear drops from her eye and
then flame consumes all. The vision ends
abruptly, the song of the fey fades, and the
room is left dark.
The last thing you see is the tear of the young dragon, hanging in the air after the rest of the vision fades.

Every port in the region has at one time or another been host to the Wayfarer Theater, a beautifully-decorated ship that is both home and base of
operations for the wayfarers. The wayfarers are both master acrobats and skilled mages, prone to dress in elaborate and eclectic costumes cobbled together from dozens of lands.

The Wayfarers are a famous troupe of performers who travel from port to port in a huge sailing ship that contains its own theater. Strangely, no one ever sees them enter or
leave port; they simply appear and vanish in the blink of an eye, some claim. In addition to being welcome performers for the rich, Wayfarers serve as elite couriers, delivering news
between major cities. They are very well paid for their services

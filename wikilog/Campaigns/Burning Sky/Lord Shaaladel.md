Regenten af Shahalesti. Den kongelige familie består blot af Lord Shaaladel og hans datter, Shalosha. Han er en af de mest interessante spillere i den magtkamp der er ved at opstå i kejserens fravær.

Lord Shaaladel is a middleaged
elf who rose from being a military commander
to the nation’s ruler during the ascension of the
Ragesian Empire. Shahalesti was in danger of being
conquered like Ragesia’s other neighbors, and
Shaaladel’s aggressive displays of force — including
the conquest and destruction of two nearby elvish
lands that were hostile to him — are credited as major
reasons why Ragesia has so far not looked east
for conquest.
During Ragesia’s annexation of its neighbors,
Lord Shaaladel lent aid, and he and his trusted aides
participated personally in battles at Coaltongue’s
side. A canny, charismatic commander, Shaaladel
is respected even by the Ragesian army, and many
expected him to succeed after Coaltongue’s death.
Rumors say that the elvish lord had been quite displeased
that the old half-orc was refusing to die of
old age.

For many years, the small island people of Ostalin battled among themselves, before finally a warlord conquered his foes and proclaimed himself Khagan. He then led his people to the mainland, conquering lands from [Sindaire](./Sindaire.md) with the aid of hippogriff aerial archers until he reached a mountain range and felt he had done enough. The Khagan had many children with many wifes, but ultimately left his nation to his half-elf son [Onamdammin](./Onamdammin.md), in whom he saw the same fire of obsession that led him to conquer. The Khagan hoped his son would be the one to topple Coaltongue and rule Ragesia.
The Khaganhold of Ostalin is a violent state, ruled poorly by Khagan Onamdammin, whose passions and desires far outstrip his talents. The capital city of Kistan is relatively small, since the city that
used to occupy the land was burned down only a few decades ago by the original Khagan. The nationâ€™s diverse landscape is renowned for its beauty, and Sindaire still seeks to reclaim it.

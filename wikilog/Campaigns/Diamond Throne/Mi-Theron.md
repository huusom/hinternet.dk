Only [De-Shamod](De-Shamod.md) surpasses Mi-Theron and [Ka-Rone](Ka-Rone.md) in importance. Both serve as key ports, Mi-Theron on the river and Ka-Rone on the sea. Mi-Theron is named for the great giantish hero who eventually led his race to victory against the [[dramojh]] in the nearby Rosewood Hills after many terrible defeats.
Originally a fortress, Mi-Theron radiates out in a circular pattern with the fort in the center. The local steward, Ai-Reyona, still uses this stronghold as her home and court. More than many stewards, Ai-Reyona is regal and imperious. In Mi-Theron, she is virtually a queen. The Lady Protector in De-Shamod grows more and more dismayed at every report of Ai-Reyona’s
activities and attitudes.
Mi-Theron’s population focuses greatly on the riverside docks and the boats that ply the waters of the [Ghostwash](Ghostwash%20River.md), delivering goods across the land. This population numbers approximately 25,000 — about a third of them [[giants]], a quarter [[sibeccai]], a quarter
[[human]], and the remainder [[faen]], [[litorian]], and a few [[mojh]].
Around the city, people work at herding cattle and growing various grains and other food crops.

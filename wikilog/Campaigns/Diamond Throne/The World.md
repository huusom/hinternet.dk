Every culture has its own name for the world, but in the Common tongue of humans it is known as Serran. Deep in all racial consciousness, known also as the akashic memory, lies the truth of the creation of the world, although the exact date of that event is contested.
A single moon hangs high in the Serran sky. On clear nights, most people perceive it as having a light blue hue. In the middle of summer, however, it is bright white. The moon shares the night sky with five planets. During the day, the sun is a warm yellow. The Lands of the Diamond Throne are but a (large) part of a single continent on Serran, which in turn is part of a larger land mass. The most explored portions are frequently called “the realm” in addition to the “Lands of the Diamond Throne.” Historically, the area was called Terrakal, and before that, the entire continent was simply “the Land of the Dragons.” The giants of today call it Dor-Erthenos.
The southernmost edge of this continent lies about 700 miles above the world’s equator. In recent days, more has become known about the continents of Pallembor—the Mysterious West—and Skaraven, where the wicked avian humanoids known as harrids come from. And at least one other continent is known to exist, to the far east, from which the giants and sibeccai originally hail.
## Keeping Time 
The Serran day is 24 hours long, although no one has names for the actual hours. People refer to noon and midnight, as well as dawn and dusk, and then measure time from there. “Two hours after noon,” they say, or “an hour before dusk.”
The year lasts 364 days. There are 13 months of 28 days each. Most often, the months are simply called “Firstmonth,” “Secondmonth,” and so on, all the way to “Lastmonth.” The giants have their own names for the months, however, as do the faen and others. The giant month names are “official,” and many people adopt the evocative, flavorful names the faen use.
The days of the week also have a variety of names, but the common names are used so widely, they are the only ones worth noting. There are seven days in each week, each with a shortened or slang form often used as well:
* Dawnday/Dawday
* Waterday/Waday
* Earthday/Erday
* Halfweekday/Hawday
* Skyday/Skiday
* Firesday/Firday
* Restingday/Resterday
## Important Days 
Although there are many festivals, sacred days, and days of ceremonial importance to the people of the realm, these are the most important ones:
;Runecurse: On this, the supposed anniversary of the death (or disappearance) of the Rune Messiah, all living creatures suffer a –1 luck penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and checks. Curse spells gain a +1 bonus to their saving throw DCs. This observance occurs on the 10th of Firstmonth.
;Remembrance: The 17th of Secondmonth is the anniversary of the last day of the Battle of the Serpent’s Heart, when the giants defeated the dramojh. This day people remember the heroes of that struggle and those slain or tortured by the evil dramojh. This is typically a day of solemn celebration.
;Landwarding: On the 3rd of Thirdmonth, folks observe the importance of the land. People work to plant on this giantish holiday, nurturing life in the soil. They also take special care of animals.
;Moon’s Eve: On the 12th day of Fourthmonth, witches (and others) celebrate the magical significance of the moon. At night, from dusk until midnight, all simple spells are one slot lower than normal to cast (0-level spells remain unaffected).
;Narasanight: The 15th of Fifthmonth is a giant festival day—although the festivities really happen at night. On this evening, giants gather to sing and tell stories. Many important ceremonies take place then as well.
;Solstices: The summer solstice occurs on the first day of Seventhmonth, and the winter solstice on the last day of Lastmonth. Each of these days is considered sacred, and most people treat them with solemn reverence. The only ceremonies on these days are those devoted to giving thanks to the land. Greenbonds in particular hold solstice days as special; those able to do so often spend these holidays in the company of the spirits of nature, who are said to celebrate in fantastic and unimaginable ways.
;Bladesong: On this day, also known as Warrior’s Day, the populace celebrates and honors those who excel with skill at arms. Usually this day, the 10th of Tenthmonth, features combative competitions and tournaments. All characters proficient in martial weapons gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and checks.
;Landsmilk: This harvest festival is celebrated in most lands, although it has a few different names, like Karatul and Bountyfest. It occurs on the 14th of Eleventhmonth.
;Vaddinalakin: The last day of Eleventhmonth is the day most sacred to witches. On this day, all witches cast spells and use their witchery powers as if they were one level higher than normal.

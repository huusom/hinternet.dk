Xavel, a mostly [Verrik](Verrik%20History.md) town, serves as the last stop before travelers headed south plunge into the dry [Southern Wastes](Southern%20Wastes.md). A welltraveled caravan route follows the western edge of the [Elder Mountains](Elder%20Mountains.md) to [Yrterot](Yrterot.md), home of Queen Uxmul of [Zalavat](Zalavat.md).
Xavel has a population of just over 4,000 people, about 3,000 of whom are verrik and the rest [[human]] and [[sibeccai]]. Its giant steward, Io-Jannal, spends so much of her time away, the town is really ruled by the verrik speaker Tikalaq. The speaker is tied into local criminal syndicates fairly closely, making Xavel a rather lawless place.
Cattleherds and goatherds are common around the city. Within its walls many people make their living working the granite and limestone hauled from quarries to the east.
Recently, the city declared independence from the Daimond Throne, and presumably loyalty to the verrik kingdom of Zalavat. Many non-verriks were expelled from the city, and some now live outside the city walls, still working their trades and dealing with the verriks within.

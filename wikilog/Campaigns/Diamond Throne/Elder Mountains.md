The ''Elder Mountains'' are, as the name implies, ancient, worn peaks, which parallel Dor-Erthenos’ coast before plunging south into the heart of the [Southern Wastes](Southern%20Wastes.md). Here they provide a barrier between that rocky desert and the more verdant wilds of [Fallanor](Fallanor.md). Two wide passes lead through the Elder Mountains: one in the [[Ghostwash River|Ghostwash river]] valley, and the other, known as ''Burkut’s Pass'', north of the verrik capital [Yrterot](Yrterot.md). Other passes, such as ''Goat’s Road'' between [Jerad](Jerad.md) and [Khorl](Khorl.md), are narrower and can prove more treacherous. The highest peak in this range is ''Jasandapur''. The Elder Mountains hold many secrets pertaining to the days before the reign of the [[dramojh]]. Here can be found some of the last legacies of the mysterious [[Crystal Weavers|crystal weavers]], beings able to spin crystal like thread, and their powerful magic. The mountains are still populated by two races, the [[faradians]] and the [[grynlocs]], both of whom were once lesser allies of the crystal weavers — students to their mastery, so to speak.

Rumors say that some of the [Gods Of The Denotholan](Gods%20Of%20The%20Denotholan.md) lie frozen forever north of the [Harrowdeep](Harrowdeep.md). The old [Council Of Magisters](Council%20Of%20Magisters.md) records that in Common Year 1422 they used magic to travel to “the top of the world,” where they found “hideous figures, each a thousand feet tall, covered in ice and frozen in positions of horror for all time.” The figures, according to the mages present, each matched some divine personage from the Denotholan.
These gods may in fact be dead, or they may simply be imprisoned. Further exploratory missions have never been launched due to the dangers involved — the distance, the weather, and horrible monsters like remorhazes, frost worms, ice trolls, white puddings, and worse.
The council estimated that the figures lay almost 2,000 miles north of [Ao-Manasa](Ao-Manasa.md). Such distances would make the frozen north a huge expanse. Some council members at the time believed that the ice was slowly marching southward.

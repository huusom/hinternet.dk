Perhaps the realm’s largest mercantile organization is also the most mysterious. The Jaren seemed to appear shortly after the disappearance of the dramojh. These people (their race is
unknown) wear long purple robes, bronze masks, and articulated gauntlets. No one has ever seen their faces or bodies — and any Jaren slain in bandit raids or grievously harmed in accidents
have simply vanished. They do not speak of their origins or their actual physical forms. One likely possibility is that the Jaren are not from this plane, but arrived here through one of the many gates still active in Thartholan. Every Jaren ever encountered has been a potent mage.
One may never meet an actual Jaren when working for them or with them, however. They have a vast network of employees and contractors from every major race. The Jaren concentrate mostly on shipping, running large caravans across the Central Plains and even through the Southern Wastes into Zalavat. They also operate on the sea, usually in hired ships with hired crews.
Occasionally one might spy strange ships made of brass and dark wood with glass sails, apparently created by the Jaren themselves.
In addition to transporting goods — buying in one area and transporting them vast distances to where there is demand — they also peddle their own wares wherever they go. Jaren goods
are always magic items, usually potions but constant and charged items as well (never scrolls).

To the west of the Diamond Throne lies the dark land of Verdune. Once a kingdom of stout human warriors, Verdune was transformed by the dramojh invasions into a menacing realm of ruined fortresses defended by dead soldiers. Still, in the last hundred years, small groups have begun attempting to rebuild and reclaim the land from the unquiet spirits that have held it for so long.
The dramojh were even less kind to the Verdunians than they were to the people they conquered later on. The dragon scions killed every intelligent creature they could find in Verdune, and then animated the dead as terrible abominations. The capital, [[Erdina]], was once a walled city surrounding a huge castle. No spellcasting was allowed in this city of 20,000 people. Now it is a vast ruin populated by undead, although many of the magical wards to prevent spellcasting in certain areas of the city remain in place. 
The dramojh did not manage to kill everyone, however. Today, descendants of the surviving natives — mostly human — dwell in forts and walled towns. Though constantly plagued by undead attacks, they hope one day to reclaim their land and their capital. They are always looking for strong swordarms and capable mages to help them.

Between the sacred peak known as Jasandapur in the [Elder Mountains](Elder%20Mountains.md) and the mystical Mount Herrosh in the [Bitter Peaks](Bitter%20Peaks.md), there lies an invisible, magical line of power. If a spellcaster casts a [[Flight]] spell and travels along that line, the duration does not end
unless he stops or veers from the line. Casters who plot a [[teleport]] path between these two mountains always arrive successfully. 
Other known travel lines include one stretching from the Rune Sea in the [[Wildlands]] of Kish to a deep valley in the [Southern Wastes](Southern%20Wastes.md), one running across the sea from a point near the city of [Sormere](Sormere.md) to [[White Shoal Island]], and another from a singular
round hill in [Verdune](Verdune.md) all the way to the cliffs known as the [[Edge of the World]]. There are certain to be many others.

Denothol was a great human hero who used legendary perseverance and magic to travel to the mystical realm where the gods lived. His story and his catalogue of the gods, their portfolios,
and their relationships is recorded in a book called the Denotholan. The deities described within are called the Gods of the Denotholan. Although there are other gods, they are usually
quite minor. The Gods of the Denotholan are those that hold (or held) large numbers of worshippers as well as great sway over their lives.
## Niashra  
The chief deity of the Denotholan pantheon, Niashra takes two forms. The first is that of the goddess of nature, or of the land, in which she appears as a beautiful human woman with flowing
golden hair and wearing leaves, vines, and flowers. The second is that of the goddess of motherhood and life, in which she looks like a very large, pregnant woman with middle-aged features and children at her feet.
Niashra is the goddess of life, of nature, and of loving and caring emotions. She is the most popular of gods, and her temples are usually wide expanses of marble and statuary, with many
pools and fountains. The majority stand in populated areas, although some are secluded in more natural surroundings. Her symbol is a woman’s face made of leaves.
## Vekik, the Runegod  
Lord of science, alchemy, and magic, Vekik as often as not is portrayed as a disembodied, ever-changing mathematical formula. Other times, he appears as a thin, bald male human whose flesh is covered in runes and symbols. Vekik is enigmatic, and his doctrine requires years of study to
truly understand. His way stresses logic over emotion and brains over brawn. His worshippers claim that the powers the [[runechildren]] possess are gifts from Vekik. He is said to be responsible for maintaining the laws that govern the physical world. His temples are small but usually tall, like towers. His symbol is a composite of various magical and mathematical
symbols. 
## Mowren  
Mowren’s duties include overseeing conflict, strife, and war, as well as fate and chance. He appears as a particularly small quickling faen with dice in his hand. When two forces of any
kind go up against each other, whether it be two contestants in a game of witch stones, two armies at war, or the force of a river smashing against a rock in the riverbed, Mowren determines the outcome.
People revere Mowren out of a sense of need rather than want. The truth is, most people see him as a meddling trickster who can’t be trusted. Mothers tell their children that Mowren is
hiding under their bed and will curse them if they don’t behave. Mowren’s temples are small—shrines, really. Few people worship Mowren exclusively, instead paying him homage when they feel they need his blessings. His symbol is a pair of dice. 
## Idonis  
Truth, beauty, and love: These are the prime aspects of Idonis’ worship. This androgynous deity has both a male and a female aspect and is called both “him” and “her.” Statues of Idonis depict a beautiful human of indeterminate gender with a book in one hand and a zither in the other. His/her worshippers fill their temples with music, poetry, and acts of love. The temples themselves are always round structures and usually brim with statues and flowers, thick carpets, and lavish tapestries. The cult of Idonis is a popular one, although many fear it,
believing the worshippers to be drug-addled fools without sense of responsibility. Idonis’ symbol is a hand holding a flower. 
## Hetragarin  
Hetragarin appears as a stern-faced female human dressed in a long silver gown. She watches over time itself, and the flow and order of all things—the passing of child to adult, the passing from skilled to unskilled, and even the passing from life to death. She is extremely regimented and particular, and so are her priests. Her temples are well-ordered structures built in concentric circles, forcing one to follow a specific path to get to the central altar. The tenets of the religion are very strict and quite humorless. Nevertheless, she is a popular patron of many — travelers, students, those wishing to master a craft or skill, and so on. Her symbol is an hourglass.
## Johrd Ironthumb  
God of craftsmanship, building, and engineering, Johrd Ironthumb is closely related to Vekik, although his worshippers usually find him and his dogma easier to understand than the Runegod’s. Iconography pictures Johrd as a massive male human, or perhaps a giant. His temples are well-constructed buildings, often incorporating some feat of engineering, such as a mighty arch or a seemingly gravity-defying monument. Worshippers of Johrd Ironthumb are laborers, craftspeople, engineers, architects, and, strangely enough, warriors. His symbol is an obelisk.

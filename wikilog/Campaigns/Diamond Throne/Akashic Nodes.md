Imbued with the psychic resonance of days long past, some sites become focal points of the akashic memory. [Akashic](Akashic%20Nodes.md)s call these places “nodes.” A node is where a large number of intelligent beings lived over a long period of time—and usually where no one currently lives (the hustle and bustle of a living city often counteracts the power of the node). These former residents, both individually and as a group, left a sort of “psychic imprint” on the area that an akashic can tap into. Thus, nodes usually occur where a city, a citadel, or some other type of community or large structure once stood, or in the ruins of the community or structure.
[Akashic](Akashic%20Nodes.md)s within a node gain an additional +1 bonus when they use their skill memory and battle memory abilities and a +2 bonus on checks to use their delve into collective memory ability.
Sometimes, a group of akashics builds a monastic guildhall at the site of a node.
Such akashic nodes are fairly common, particularly in the [Southern Wastes](Southern%20Wastes.md), along the east coast, and on the banks of the [Ghostwash](Ghostwash%20River.md).

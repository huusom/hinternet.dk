The Diamond Throne is a hereditary seat of power that represents a giantish king or queen. The giants actually call their land Dor-Erthenos, which means in their own tongue, “land to the west.” This presents a somewhat ironic situation, because while the giants (and the sibeccai, whom they brought with them) hail from the east, Dor-Erthenos is actually the farthest eastern land known to most people of the realm.
Each king or queen, also called the ''Lord or Lady Protector'', is approved by a council called the Observance. If the Observance does not approve of an heir apparent, or sometimes even of a
currently reigning monarch, they pass the position on to another relative or even another giantish noble family.
The current monarch, Lady Protector Ia-Thordani, has been in power only a few years. The single reservation the Observance had regarding her ascension to the Diamond Throne was her unmarried state. She is currently accepting suitors.
The Observance exists only to watch over the monarch and provide advice and counsel. This body has no other direct power. Some residents wish to see members of other races allowed into the Observance, but currently its membership is entirely giant.
Under the Lady Protector are two giants known as the ''High Stewards of the Land''. They act as generals, advisors, and administrators, one watching over the North and one watching over the
South.
Beneath the High Stewards are the local magistrates, called ''stewards''. These are regional governors, each based out of a major city. The Lands of the Diamond Throne hold 16 different stewardships.
Members of nongiant races can become ''speakers'', representing the causes and concerns of their race or area. The speakers work with the stewards and help govern the people in a region.
Ancestral aristocratic titles, in place since ancient times among humans, still remain and carry some weight — at least among humans. (The holdings and estates of dukes, earls, and counts still dot the landscape, particularly in the North.) Likewise, litorian tribes continue to follow their own chieftains, as they have for millennia, and faen communities in the Harrowdeep retain their own leaders as well. The giants recognize these positions as influential and important, but not as a part of their own government; in the eyes of giantish law, a human noble or litorian chief is no more or less than any other individual under their rule.
Under the Diamond Throne, the cities have become connected with well-maintained, paved roads wide enough even for the passage of large giantish wagons pulled by radonts. Aqueducts
transport water to soak the crops and to provide communities with adequate safe water. Giant patrols prevent, or at least decrease, attacks by dangerous beasts and raids by bandits and
other enemies, such as the [[chorrim]].

Membership in this rather bleak faith is small. These people consider life but a brief respite from eternal torment, both before and after a person lives in the world. Members of this
cult believe that the greatest good one can do is to prevent another from dying, and that anyone with the power to raise the dead should do so as much as possible, no matter what the
cost or the circumstances. Not surprisingly, they fear death with an abject certainty and will do anything to avoid its horrible clutches.
This religion has no temples or shrines, only a handful of holy scriptures that get passed around from believer to believer, often used to convince nonbelievers. Those that can get over their fear of death use the religion as a license to live life to its fullest.

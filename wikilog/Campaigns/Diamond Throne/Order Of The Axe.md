The Order of the Axe is the largest and most powerful knightly order in the Lands of the Diamond Throne. It has 37 chapters, each with its own chapterhouse located in a keep. Each chapter may have as few as 10 or as many as 300 members in its roster. Because of the nature of the order, however, they work in secret.
Sir Redic Pynchar founded the Order of the Axe more than 300 years ago on the principle of maintaining order, peace, and justice in the name of the Diamond Throne. Ironically, the
Diamond Throne disavowed — or perhaps simply dismissed — the group almost immediately because it was not a giantish organization (A giantish order called the Knights of the Diamond
serves the Diamond Throne throughout the realm).
Sir Redic, who claimed knighthood by right of blood (he traced his lineage back to the nobles of Sennes), was outraged at this slight. The Order of the Axe rededicated itself to those
original goals — order, peace, and justice — but as a group in opposition to the throne. Thus, the Order of the Axe became a contradiction: a group dedicated to upholding order but not
supporting the rule of those in power. They work outside the bounds of law to seek justice. They protect the innocent, but not always through lawful means (See [[Knight of the Axe]]).
The Order of the Axe does not seek open rebellion but would like to see, one day, the return of the individual kingdoms, duchies, and principalities that controlled the land 1,700 years
ago.

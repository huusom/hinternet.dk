In and around Sormere, on what is called the Aged Peninsula, humans attempt to cling to their old ways as much as possible. The lingering legacy of the Sennes Kingdom and Queen Adrilashe flickers here like a candle in the darkness — or so goes the attitude of many of those who live here.
When the dramojh took control of the realm, they pushed east from their power center in the faraway [Bitter Peaks](Bitter%20Peaks.md). By the time they reached Sormere, humans could put up only minimal physical resistance. Thus, much of Sormere remained untouched. Some further speculate that there was something about Sormere — or something ancient hidden there — that the dramojh
wished to avoid. In any event, this allowed many inhabitants of the “Old City,” as it is called, to remain free of enslavement. 
The giant ''[[En-Fallasash]]'', steward of Sormere, is very taken with the ways of the city, even though they are not particularly giantish. Ornate, gothic architecture, elaborate forms of dress, and a complicated code of mannerisms and behavior distinguish this city from most others. Most of the 14,000 people who call it home are [[human]] (about three quarters), with the rest mainly [[faen]] and [[giants]]. Only a very few [Verrik](Verrik%20History.md), [[sibeccai]], and [[litorians]] even come here, let alone stay. And more than in any other place, [[mojh]] are unwelcome here. The inhabitants say Sormere is the “most human city in the realm” — and not without a bit of implied prejudice. The “old nobility,” as it is called, remains influential in Sormere and throughout the Aged Peninsula. Castles and keeps inhabited by aristocrats and wealthy landlords dot the region.

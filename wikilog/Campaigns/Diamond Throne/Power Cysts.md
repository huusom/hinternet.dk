Like tidal pools left behind as the tide recedes, ''power cysts'' are areas where the magic of creation still flows strong. In these places, power pervades the very air, not to mention the rocks, soil, water, or other nearby matter. This magical saturation often takes tangible form, such as one or more permanent supernatural or spell-like effects in the area. Although the effects could be anything — and they are always different in different cysts — the following list provides some ideas:
* Plants in the area grow a strange color.
* Everything in the area weighs half as much as normal.
* Every creature in the area can speak telepathically to every other creature in the area.
* All wounded creatures are affected by lesser battle healing (1/ day).
* All creatures in the area are affected by lesser ability boost (1/ day).
* All creatures in the area are affected by canny effort (1/day).
* All creatures in the area are affected by saving grace (1/day).
* All creatures in the area are affected by distraction at all times.
* The entire area is affected by unknown at all times.
Further, spellcasters can draw power from a ''power cyst''. A mage in the area who makes a successful caster power check (DC 20 + spell level) can power a spell without using a spell slot. A power cyst usually can power only about 1,000 levels of spells before it is drained and the area becomes normal. A magical cyst measures from 20 to 100 feet across and takes the shape of an invisible globe. Upon entering such a place, a spellcaster immediately knows something special has happened. A [[Knowledge]] (magic) check (DC 15) can properly identify what is going on.
Most ''power cysts'' are found in isolated areas, because greedy mages eventually drained the magic from the ones that were out in the open. Once they find a cyst, powerful creatures or mages often
attempt to claim it, building a large keep or tower around the site.

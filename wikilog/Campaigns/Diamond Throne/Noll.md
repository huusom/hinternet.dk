This island nation is a realm of seafarers. The capital and largest city is [Caracha](Caracha.md), which boasts a population of 6,000. Like all of Noll, most of Carachaâ€™s residents are humans, but many verrik, sibeccai, and even some giants live there (although Noll is technically beyond the reach of the Diamond Throne). The ruler, King Hadderoch II, is a kindly man. His devious brother Giliston covets the throne.
The [Unara](Unara.md), found in the Free Cities of the South, occasionally come to Noll as well. Tales speak of an underwater kingdom of
theirs, to the south and east of Noll.

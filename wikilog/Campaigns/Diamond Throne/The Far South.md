South of [Fallanor](Fallanor.md) lie the “Free Cities of the South,” coastal city-states that pay allegiance to neither Fallanor nor the
Diamond Throne. Little is known of these places, but the few explorers and merchants to journey there and return claim there
are six major cities populated by [[humans]], [Verrik](Verrik%20History.md), and a curious race of amphibious humanoids called the [Unara](Unara.md). 
The cities are [[Utos]], [[Mallacosta]], [[Suherlen]], [[Inoosh]], [[Genek]], and [[Capellosha]]. 
These places are each unique. Utos is ruled by philosopherpriests, Genek by a deformed king magically transformed into a gargantuan lizardlike creature. Insular Mallacosta’s harbor is lined with underwater traps that can destroy a ship and walls so high as to be unassailable. Suherlen is a matriarchy where the uncomely are forced to wear masks, while Inoosh is ruled by an undead queen who favors only spellcasters. In Capellosha, City of Idols, it is said that every sixth person is a priest, and that they worship even more gods than the faen.
Or so the traders’ tales go.

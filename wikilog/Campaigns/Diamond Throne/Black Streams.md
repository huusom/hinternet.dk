The existence of the [[dramojh]] and the damage they did to the land has left what would seem to be an indelible mark on Dor-Erthenos. This corruption isn’t always obvious. Much of the time it remains insidiously hidden. Such is the case with the black streams. Black streams are pure flows of negative energy — [The Dark](The%20Dark.md) — loose within the world. These invisible currents often change course, as well as ebb and flow in strength. Usually, one cannot even notice them until the negative energy begins to poolin an area. When this happens, the black stream begins animating dead creatures; causing sickness, rot, and decay in living things; and creating a general feeling of malaise, depression, or anger in intelligent beings. Black streams appear throughout the North and to a lesser extent in the South of the realm. They are most common in the [Bitter Peaks](Bitter%20Peaks.md).

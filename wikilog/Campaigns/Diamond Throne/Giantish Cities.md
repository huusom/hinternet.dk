Giantish cities are a wonder to behold. The giants present everything, from the wide, paved streets to the looming buildings and staggeringly tall towers, on a dramatically large scale. With their masterful crafting techniques, the giants work stone so that it has no seams or joints. Structures have a natural look, interior chambers feel like well-lit caverns, and everywhere the buildings accommodate trees and plants, filling the city with life.
Giantish cities are laid out with wide plazas (usually containing multiple fountains), carefully engineered aqueducts, and wellmaintained, broad roads leading in and out. These engineers always build a city as a series of circles radiating out from a central hub.
Occasionally, depending on the terrain, they may lay them out as a number of circle patterns radiating form different hubs. Giantish cities always have well-maintained sewers with large channels.
Since the giantsâ€™ arrival, the giantish style of architecture has gained popularity even in places where giants are few in number. Twentyfoot ceilings, 10-foot-wide hallways, and huge doorways are commonplace throughout the realm.

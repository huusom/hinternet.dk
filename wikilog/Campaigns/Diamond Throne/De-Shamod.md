De-Shamod is the capital, home of [The Diamond Throne](The%20Diamond%20Throne.md) and the most fabulous of the beautiful cities of the giants. A marvel of engineering, the city is built atop a pair of vast artificial mounds, one on each side of the river. The steep, sheer sides of the mounds are paved and carved with elaborate murals in relief. The sides of these mounds rise 70 feet above the plains around them, with wide ramps providing access into the city and down into the docks along the river’s banks. Massive walls mark the perimeter of each section of the city, around the top edges of both mounds.
Tall statues line De-Shamod’s broad, stone-paved streets. Its buildings stretch both high and wide with seamless stonework. Trees and flowering plants blend into the city’s layout, making
each street seem more like a verdant canyon. Banners of red and green drape from rooftop to rooftop and run down the smooth stone walls surrounding the city.
The grandest city on the continent, De-Shamod boasts a population of 50,000. About a third of these are [[giants]], another third [[humans]], and the rest a mixture of other races. De-Shamod boasts the greatest schools and universities in the realm, including Se-Heton, the largest and most prestigious academy devoted to the study of magic, founded by the [Council Of Magisters](Council%20Of%20Magisters.md). 
The monarch of the Diamond Throne personally appoints the steward of the city, currently a particularly massive giant named Dro-Kareth. A speaker of every major local race other than
mojh — human, faen, litorian, sibeccai, and verrik — works with Dro-Kareth and his staff of advisors. 
De-Shamod is a center for commerce and trade, with a massive dockyard on both sides of the river. The city itself sprawls across to cover both banks. The two sides are joined by so many
mammoth span bridges, it seems as though the city itself was built upon the river.

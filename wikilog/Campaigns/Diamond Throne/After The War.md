With the elimination of the dramojh, what was once Terrakal had become literally a new realm. A massive rebuilding effort, spearheaded by the giants, has helped the land recover. Generations
of humans, litorians, faen, and others have been born without ever knowing the cruel yoke of the dramojh or the darkness and fear that pervaded the land while the demon-dragons ruled.
## Council of Magisters  
Soon after the defeat of the dramojh, a human magister named Thenomas Bittermere gathered a number of other powerful magisters together to trade knowledge. Soon, this council became one of the strongest and most influential (but decidedly nonpolitical) groups in the land. The [Council Of Magisters](Council%20Of%20Magisters.md) found itself fighting powerful magical threats, traveling to other worlds, and embarking on all manner of adventures. The members even used spells to travel to far-flung locations on Serran, including the so-called frozen “top of the world.”
The council founded an academy in [De-Shamod](De-Shamod.md) and another in [Thayn](Thayn.md). It established and enforced magical policies. For example, the members sealed off Castle Mabb, an ancient fortress that held ''the Pillars of Life and Death''. The original builders of the castle created these pillars, one of which tapped directly into positive energy and the other into negative energy, in order to draw on the power released in their confluence. Many died trying to access this power, and the council eventually used magic to shut the place up, decrying the unstable energy as too dangerous for anyone to use. Likewise, the group oversaw the destruction of many dramojh
artifacts and began to explore and catalog the strange, otherworldly inhabitants and portals in Thartholan.
However, in Common Year 1668, the council fell apart due to internal strife, the primary instigator of which was the loresong faen Jaedyn Darksight. She encouraged the council to try to use its power to wrest a small state from the giants and set it up as a magocracy. The council disbanded rather than risk such insurgence.
## Rise of the Fallanor Empire  
In the Common Year 1699, the Empress Justaria became the first to sit upon the throne of the [Fallanor](Fallanor.md) Empire, a harsh militaristic regime lording over mostly wilderness and scattered settlements. The empire, not wishing to make enemies of the giants, paid homage to the Diamond
Throne and made sure never to cross its northern border beyond the [Redwood](Redwood.md). In the Lands of the Diamond Throne, little is known about Fallanor to this day, but the empire is no friend to the verrik in Zalavat. 
## The Inshon Infestation of Noll  
In Common Year 1751, the island of [Noll](Noll.md) was all but overrun by the amphibious humanoids known as [[inshon]]s. These horrible, mutated creations seemed to arrive with shocking suddenness. No one knows where they came from, although it became frighteningly clear how quickly they could spawn. Great armies of adventurers and mercenaries gathered in Noll to wipe out the infestation, but even today, just when it seems the creatures have all been eradicated or driven off, a new generation of them appears to plague the citizens.

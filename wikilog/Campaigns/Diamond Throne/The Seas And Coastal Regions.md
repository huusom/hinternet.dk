The ''Great Eastern Sea'', also known as the Shining Sea and the Home of the Sun, is vast. No one has ever made it across its waves except the giants, and they did so only once. No one who
has left the shores of the Lands of the Diamond Throne to cross the sea has ever come back.
The Devanian coast runs from the mouth of the [Ghostwash River](Ghostwash%20River.md) northward. In the past, this region included the Kingdom of Devania, known for the incredible craftsmanship and skill of
its people. This territory is dotted with ruined castles along the coast and other ruins farther inland. It is still not a heavily populated area.
The ''Sonish Sea''’s southern waters are warm and blue-green. Except for high summer, which is typhoon season, the Sonish Sea is known to be calm and bursting with fish. The inhabitants
of the southern coast ply its waters with fishing boats and return with full nets. Rumors speak of distant southern islands laden with silks, spices, and other treasures, as well as the small, faenlike folk that live there, but these tales are unconfirmed. 
Between the Wildlands of Kish and the Jungles of Naveradel, travelers find the ''Gulf of Firesight''. The gulf gets its name from the encircling volcanic ring so intense that one always sees fire on the horizon when plying its waters. These are ship-friendly waters, but the volcanoes keep people from settling on the shores around it.
Far to the west lies the ''Gulf of Filan'' and the ''Sea of Dreams''. This is thought to be a turbulent, unforgiving sea, but in truth few sailors from the Lands of the Diamond Throne have ever actually sailed it. Even fewer sailors have traversed the northern sea and the ocean west of [[Pallembor]]. Some claim these waters are full of magical creatures that influence the dreams of those who sleep along its shores — or on board a ship sailing nearby.

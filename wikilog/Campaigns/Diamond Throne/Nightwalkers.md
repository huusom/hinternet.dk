Throughout the Lands of the Diamond Throne, a powerful and well-connected organization called the Nightwalkers uses thievery, smuggling, assassination, and occasionally slaving to earn
vast amounts of gold. Many estimate that this organized crime syndicate has more wealth and power than many kingdoms. 
The Nightwalkers comprise various subdivisions called “elements.” Each element controls a territory, and strict rules prevent members of one element from operating in or sometimes
even entering another element’s territory. A leader, or “prince,” controls each element. They occasionally convene in different locales to discuss business and issues of the day. The leader of the strongest element, the Night King, is the most powerful and influential member of the organization.
The elements occasionally feud, but this is actually fairly rare. Most often, the Nightwalkers avoid conflict of any kind, even with local authorities or opposing groups (like the [Jaren](Jaren.md) or the [Order Of The Axe](Order%20Of%20The%20Axe.md)). They prefer to use such tactics as blackmail, assassination, and sowing dissent rather than open warfare.
The current Night King is a sibeccai in [Ka-Rone](Ka-Rone.md) named ''Urthoss the Dark''. He is incredibly secretive and ruthless, even by Nightwalker standards.

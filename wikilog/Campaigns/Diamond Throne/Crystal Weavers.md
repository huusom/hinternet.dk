Long ago, before the dramojh invaded, strange creatures called the crystal weavers dwelled along the Devanian coast. These creatures could weave a special “spun crystal” into anything they desired. They could create anything out of crystal — weapons, armor, tools, statuary, and so on — and the basis for their creations was crystal thread no thicker than normal thread. These threads were ultra-strong, however, and could support up to 500 lbs. 
While woven or crystalline items are made entirely out of crystal, the crystal weavers could also lace noncrystalline objects with their crystal threads, making the objects much harder and
rendering them virtually immune to the passage of time. Although this technique often enhanced wooden objects, it also kept even scrolls and books from that time, well over a thousand
years ago, intact and usable today.
The crystal weavers disappeared shortly after the coming of the dramojh and — despite rumors and a few alleged sightings in the [Elder Mountains](Elder%20Mountains.md) — they have never been seen since. (But
see [[Crystal Warrior]]). Their legacy remains, with crystal-laced items and objects of woven crystal — often considered artwork, even if the original intent was functional — highly sought after still today. Wielding a crystal sword or staff is a potent status symbol. (See equipment section for more information about crystalline and crystallaced.)

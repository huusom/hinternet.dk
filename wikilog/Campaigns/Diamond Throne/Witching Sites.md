As mentioned in the [[Witch#Appendix: Witching Sites and Times|appendix]], certain sites are important or even sacred to [[witch]]es. These witching sites are usually isolated vales, still pools, undisturbed glens, or hilltops with a commanding view on starry nights. However, a witching site is not always linked to nature. Sometimes, a witching site can be found within a ruined castle or in the middle of an old city. These sites are
sometimes called the “footprints of the gods,” because they correspond to areas that involved extensive activity by extremely powerful beings in the past. Thus, the [[Fields of Yallatonan]], some
of the [[Vnaxian]] ruins, and the city of [Ravadan](Ravadan.md) contain a number of witching sites. Witches find these locales using the Sight. In a witching site, witch characters use their witchery powers to cast their spells at one level higher than their actual level. Level-dependent witchery abilities gain +1 level as well.

Related to the ancient [Cult Of The Fleshrunes](Cult%20Of%20The%20Fleshrunes.md), the Runepriests revere the power of the [[runechildren]]. However, they do not worship this power. In fact, contrary to their name, they are not a true religious organization at all. The Runepriests’ primary goal is to artificially recreate the [[Rune Messiah]]. 
The Runepriests have established small “temples” throughout the realm where they engage in clandestine research. This research involves using magic and alchemy on kidnap victims —
some runechildren, some not — in order to discover the source of the runechild’s abilities, how to instill these abilities into nonrunechildren, and how to control and increase the potency of
the whole process. Each Runepriest temple works individually. In a sense, they work competitively, although it is not a hostile competition, and Runepriests from one temple sometimes work with those of another on a joint project.
Some Runepriests have established controlled breeding programs, where they manipulate communities (often magically) so that desirable candidates marry and produce offspring. They
seek to engineer a certain strain they believe to be more conducive to runechildren and eventually the Rune Messiah. This, obviously, is an incredibly long-term plan. 
Sometimes membership in the Runepriests is a secret. Secret members can play “matchmaker” in a village or town to facilitate the group’s breeding programs or maintain a position in a community to watch for candidates for their experiments. However, the Runepriest temples are not secret, and some members are very open. Most people simply have no idea what goes on inside them or what the Runepriests’ real goals are.

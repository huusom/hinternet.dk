The Central Plains stretch between the two major mountain ranges of the Diamond Throne lands, [[the Elders]] and the [Bitter Peaks](Bitter%20Peaks.md). This temperate area stays cold and snow-covered in the
winter and hot in the summer. Savage winds, particularly in late summer and late winter, blow throughout the plains.
The plains are home to various nomadic [[litorian]] tribes, as well as a number of small [[human]] towns and villages. The Central Plains, in fact, make up the heart of the Lands of the Diamond Throne. The largest giantish cities lie along the [Ghostwash](Ghostwash%20River.md), which winds through the plains on its way east. Thanks to the giants’ engineering skill, well-built and well-maintained roads now crisscross the plains. Still, even the giantish patrols cannot
make this vast area 100 percent secure. Wolves, various dire animals, ankhegs, bullettes, axe beaks, and even more dangerous creatures pose a threat to travelers. Raiding parties of [[rhodin]] come out of the South into the plains, making them the litorians’ hated foes.
Throughout the Central Plains, travelers frequently come across standing stones, ancient burial mounds, and other such monuments. These were created by the human tribes who lived there long ago, before the dramojh, and before Queen Adrilashe’s kingdom of Sennes.

The streets of the frontier city of Jerad bustle with members of almost every race. It stands at the mouth of the Goatâ€™s Road, a pass through the [Elder Mountains](Elder%20Mountains.md) that leads to [Khorl](Khorl.md). Jerad is a [[human]] city with a human name and a population of just over 5,000. Human herders, a few [Verrik](Verrik%20History.md) merchants and traders, and a hodgepodge of folk of other races and professions dwell here. [[Litorians]] may very well make up a larger percentage of Jerad than any other city. The humans of this area have always been on good terms with the local litorian tribes.
The steward, an ambitious giant named Re-Tarranan, takes his job very seriously. The people of Jerad are fairly independent, though, so he maintains a force of sibeccai to enforce the law of the Diamond Throne. This fairly heavy-handed solution has brought the city some small amount of grief and trouble.

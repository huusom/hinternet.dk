The largest seaport on the Devanian coast, Ka-Rone is a giantish city built atop the ruins of a major human city that the dramojh had been all but gutted. The original settlement was named
Reveran, and more people called it home than any other human city of the time — it was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Sennes.
More than 28,000 people live and work in Ka-Rone, split almost exactly in thirds among the [[giants]], the [[sibeccai]], and the [[humans]] (the city’s faen, verrik, litorian, and mojh populations are negligible). Built upon the Ghostwash delta, Ka-Rone feels like a number of small towns joined by bridges and artificial platforms created by the engineering genius of the giants.
Tu-Methus, the steward of Ka-Rone, is a well-known adventurer and hero now quite aged. This former sailor knows the sea well, garnering him the respect of ship captains who drop anchor
in his harbor. Ships from [Ao-Manasa](Ao-Manasa.md), [Khorl](Khorl.md), [Noll](Noll.md), [Fallanor](Fallanor.md), and even the faraway [[Free Cities of the South]] come to Ka-Rone. Many of the ancient giantish ships used to sail across the [[Great Eastern Sea]] also still wait in this important seaport’s harbor — the giants’ expert craftsmanship has preserved these stone vessels for more than five centuries.

As one moves south out of the Central Plains, the climate gets drier and the terrain more barren. Even in the heart of winter, it rarely snows in the Southern Wastes. This wasteland hosts few cities, although ruined sites with strange architecture, dating back to the [[Vnaxian]] civilization, make their presence known: Odd pyramid structures and huge stone heads rise up out of the brown and red soil. Some of these ruins still hold ancient secrets and treasures from the mysterious [Verrik](Verrik%20History.md) who built them. But unplundered ruins always harbor traps involving mental attacks and illusions.
A few settlements struggle to eke out an existence in this region, mostly through mining opportunities. The despicable humanoids known as [[rhodin]] live in great numbers within the Southern Wastes, raiding and stealing what they can. (They also venture north into the Central Plains.) 
The Wastes are home to many varied creatures: [[ant lion]]s, [[basilisk]]s (and greater basilisks), [[cockatrice]]s, [[Death Dog|death dogs]], [[dragonnes]], [[gorgon]]s, [[kamadan]], [[lamia]]s, [[rhodin]], [[sphinx]]es, and more.
Farther south, into the verrik land of Zalavat, the Southern Wastes become a sandy, dune-filled desert.

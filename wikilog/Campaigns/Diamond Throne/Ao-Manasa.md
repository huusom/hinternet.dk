Ao-Manasa is also a busy port city. Gold has been discovered far north of here, and now would-be prospectors and miners use the port of Ao-Manasa as a staging area to launch their expeditions. Odd tales of beasts and even undiscovered peoples along the northern coast come back with the returning miners, as well as stories of endless frozen lands of eternal winter.
Of all the giantish cities, this is the most remote. About 17,000 people call Ao-Manasa home. A quarter of these are [[giants]], another quarter [[sibeccai]], another quarter [[human]], and the rest [[faen]]. These are a rugged folk, accustomed to ill-tempered weather and the rough surrounding lands. Flocks of goats and sheep graze outside the city, attracting numerous predators for wary shepherds and goatherds to spot.
The steward of Ao-Manasa, Gri-Taresh, has watched over the city for almost 100 years now. He commands his peopleâ€™s respect through his wise and practical solutions to problems. For example, when he saw how well the bounty on wolves and dire animals helped protect the region from predators, he placed a bounty on goblins, trolls, hags, crabmen, and other dangers to the city. The bounties draw adventurers and mercenaries to the area to help control these threats.

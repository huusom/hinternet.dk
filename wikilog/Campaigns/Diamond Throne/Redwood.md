The Redwood, as its name suggests, is a forest of massive redwood trees. Within the confines of this damp region, the air feels cool and still, sheltered from the sea winds by long, rocky ridges. These same ridges shape most of the coastline north of the woods into tall, unassailable cliffs, the tops of which are buffeted by strong winds. These are known as the ''Cliffs of Pain'', thanks to the ice crystals driven by the cold, harsh winds atop these cliffs.
The northern/northwestern edge of the Redwood marks the northern edge of [Fallanor](Fallanor.md). Ever worried about its borders, the empire keeps this wood well patrolled and watches the only road
through it, which runs from the city of [Ravadan](Ravadan.md) in the north down to [[Shana]], the coastal capital of Fallanor.
These patrols also help make the Redwood particularly safe considering its size. Few dangerous beasts call it home.

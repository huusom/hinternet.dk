The 543 volumes of the Bru-Nothan, or the “Giantish Histories,” is certainly one of the most reliable and complete historical documents available today. However, it deals mostly with giantish events before they came to the western continent and established the Diamond Throne.
The Denotholan offers an insight into ancient history, but most scholars consider much of it myth rather than historical fact. This is a book that details early times, but deals mostly with the gods.
Although their civilization and ability to write extends back much farther than that of many other races, the [Verrik](Verrik%20History.md) keep only spotty historical records, because they have always had the [Akashic](Akashic%20Nodes.md)s to carry all knowledge. Verrik records, therefore, exist mostly in ceremonial
or decorative inscriptions.
Litorians keep only oral histories. [[Sibeccai]] rely on the Giantish Histories. [[Faen]] have extensive records of the history of their own race.

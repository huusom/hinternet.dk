South of [Verdune](Verdune.md) lies Thartholan, a land filled with ruins from other planes and dimensions and inhabited by displaced
creatures. The dramojh once used powerful energies to raid alternate dimensions for slaves and magical treasure.
Much of what they brought back remained in Thartholan. This land contains the ruins of entire cities that once stood on distant planes, torn in their entirety from their original homes.
Once a powerful human kingdom, Thartholan is now “a land of madmen and the palpable madness that afflicts them,” as the giantish king Jo-Othem once said. The few remaining native humans do indeed hold a reputation for madness, subjected as they are to the strange creatures, objects, energies, and sites ripped from other planes and now covering their land. 
Many open gates to other dimensions remain active in Thartholan. Not only do such gates present a risk of letting more outsiders into this world, but many of the gates are invisible. A person can simply wander into one and never be heard from again.
[[Balatosh]], the former capital, once floated high in the sky. A series of devastating dramojh attacks eventually brought the city crashing to the ground. Although spells and wards kept parts of it surprisingly intact, the city is now a strange ruin in the
middle of a crater. 
Obviously, most of the inhabitants of Thartholan are like nothing else in the world. The strange humanoids called [[alabast]]s live here, unable to return home. Demons and angels, likewise marooned, now reside in Thartholan. However, most of the “kidnapped”
creatures of Thartholan that have not yet made it back to their worlds are alien beasts and odd creatures. Occasionally, a displaced golem or other construct from another plane is spotted wandering the fields of the kingdom, attempting to fulfill its original, alien mission.
A trip to Thartholan can be a very strange experience, to say the least.

The ''Bitter Peaks'', on the other hand, are tall, jagged, and nighimpassable mountains west of [[Elder Mountains|the Elders]]. Only a few narrow passes, such as Bonegate Pass, give way into [Verdune](Verdune.md), [Thartholan](Thartholan.md), and [[Pallembor]]. The range’s tallest point is ''Mount Herrosh''. The stronghold of the [[dramojh]] in their time, the Peaks still hide many of the tyrants’ ruined citadels. Wise folk give such places a wide berth.

Near [Zalavat](Zalavat.md) but even more remote lies the Fallanor Empire. Populated by strange beings and beasts, most of the lands of the
Fallanor Emperor are simply uncharted temperate wilderness. The actual “empire” truly exists only along the east coast. The cities there attract both merchants and pirates. Truth be told, the only time one hears of Fallanor in the Lands of the Diamond Throne is when discussing some rare spice or other imported goods, or when the emperor sends an envoy to pay tribute to the Diamond Throne.
The capital of Fallanor is the bustling metropolis of [[Shana]], a vast habitation that is a mixture of strange architecture and a
tent city. The only other city of note is Vatorth, also on the coast, known for its militaristic warlords and strange (and strict) laws. 
South of Fallanor lie the “Free Cities of the South,”(commonly known as [The Far South](The%20Far%20South.md)) coastal city-states that pay allegiance to neither Fallanor nor the Diamond Throne.

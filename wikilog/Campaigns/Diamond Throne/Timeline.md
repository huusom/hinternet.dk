Two dating systems are still used today. Although most people use the system developed by the humans, known as Common Years, the [[giants]] retain their traditional, much older system of
dating, which nongiants simply call “Giant Time.” It is worth noting that officially the [Verrik](Verrik%20History.md) use neither system, and refer to past dates only in terms of today. (“One day 751 years ago…”).
